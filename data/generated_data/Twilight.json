                "text": "Preface\n    I'd never given much thought to how I would die — though I'd had reasonenough in the last few months — but even if I had, I would not haveimagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes ofthe hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone Iloved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it'snot reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. Chapter 1 First Sight\n      My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It wasseventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I waswearing my favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearingit as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small townnamed Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains onthis inconsequential town more than any other place in the United Statesof America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade thatmy mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was inthis town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until Iwas fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these pastthree summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for twoweeks instead. It was to Forks that I now exiled myself— an action that I took withgreat horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved thevigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me — the last of a thousand times — before I goton the plane. \"You don't have to do this. \"My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt aspasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leavemy loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course shehad Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be foodin the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she gotlost, but still…\"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been sayingthis lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi. \"\"I will. \"\"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted. \"You can come home whenever you want —I'll come right back as soon as you need me. \"But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise. \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged. \"It'll be great. I love you, Mom. \"She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and shewas gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a smallplane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I wasa little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemedgenuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first timewith any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for highschool and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyonewould call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. Iknew he was more than a little confused by my decision — like my motherbefore me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen— just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primarymotivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, wasthat I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lightson top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off theplane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automaticallycaught and steadied me. \"You haven't changed much. How's Renée? \"\"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad. \" I wasn't allowed to callhim Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable forWashington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winterwardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk ofthe cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we werestrapped in. \"What kind of car? \" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car foryou\" as opposed to just \"good car. \"\"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy. \"\"Where did you find it? \"\"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push? \" La Push is the tiny Indianreservation on the coast. \"No. \"\"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted. That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blockingpainful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"sohe can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap. \"\"What year is it? \" I could see from his change of expression that thiswas the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine — it's only a few yearsold, really. \"I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give upthat easily. \"When did he buy it? \"\"He bought it in 1984, I think. \"\"Did he buy it new? \"\"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties — or late fifties atthe earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch — Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able tofix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic…\"\"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like thatanymore. \"The thing, I thought to myself… it had possibilities — as a nickname, atthe very least. \"How cheap is cheap? \" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromiseon. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift. \"Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car. \"\f\"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here. \" He was looking ahead at theroad when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing hisemotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straightahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it. \" No need to addthat my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need tosuffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth — orengine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks. We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and thatwas pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green:\n　　the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with acanopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered downgreenly through the leaves. It was too green — an alien planet. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small,two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days oftheir marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had — theearly ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that neverchanged, was my new — well, new to me — truck. It was a faded red color,with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, Iloved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged —the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched,surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks! \" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be justthat much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of eitherwalking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in theChief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the westbedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it hadbeen belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light bluewalls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window —these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had evermade were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. Thedesk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modemstapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulationfrom my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chairfrom my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I wouldhave to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on thatfact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left mealone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogetherimpossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smileand look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at thesheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to goon a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have tothink about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred andfifty-seven — now fifty-eight — students; there were more than sevenhundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids herehad grown up together — their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to\fmy advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan,sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps — all thethings that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or redhair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but softsomehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eyecoordination to play sports without humiliating myself — and harming bothmyself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bagof bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myselfup after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as Ibrushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, butalready I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it wasvery clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all depended on color. Ihad no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that Iwas lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. Andif I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, whatwere my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn'trelate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to thananyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactlythe same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same thingsthrough my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. Allthat mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning. I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. Theconstant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fadeinto the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and lateradded the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight,when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I couldfeel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the skyhere; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck atschool. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended toavoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wifeand family."

One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left mealone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogetherimpossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smileand look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at thesheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to goon a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have tothink about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred andfifty-seven — now fifty-eight — students; there were more than sevenhundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids herehad grown up together — their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to\fmy advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan,sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps — all thethings that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or redhair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but softsomehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eyecoordination to play sports without humiliating myself — and harming bothmyself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bagof bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myselfup after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as Ibrushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, butalready I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it wasvery clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all depended on color. Ihad no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that Iwas lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. Andif I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, whatwere my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn'trelate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to thananyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactlythe same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same thingsthrough my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. Allthat mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning. I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. Theconstant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fadeinto the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and lateradded the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight,when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I couldfeel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the skyhere; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck atschool. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended toavoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wifeand family."

Nothingwas changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in anattempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplacein the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one ofthe three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpfulnurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to lastyear's. Those were embarrassing to look at — I would have to see what Icould do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I wasliving here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie hadnever gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the houseanymore. I donned my jacket — which had the feel of a biohazard suit —and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately asI reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by thedoor, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots wasunnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn'tpause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get outof the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under\fmy hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie hadobviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelledfaintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly,to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radioworked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was notobvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be theForks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matchinghouses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees andshrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of theinstitution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences,the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over thedoor reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure itwas off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead ofcircling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out ofthe toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with darkhedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door. Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office wassmall; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-fleckedcommercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clockticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if therewasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a longcounter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly coloredflyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, oneof which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She waswearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up. \"Can I help you? \"\"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awarenesslight her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter ofthe Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile ofdocuments on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for. \"Ihave your schedule right here, and a map of the school. \" She broughtseveral sheets to the counter to show roe. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to eachon the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was tobring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, likeCharlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back asconvincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad tosee that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At homeI'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were includedin the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a newMercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shinyVolvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in aspot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully Iwouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. Istuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, andsucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No onewas going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck. I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk,crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticedwith relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large\fblack \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt mybreathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached thedoor. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoatsthrough the door. The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just insidethe door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale,with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here. I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had anameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw myname — not an encouraging response — and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducingme to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me inthe back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the readinglist the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare,Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting… andboring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or ifshe would think that was cheating. I went through different argumentswith her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skinproblems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talkto me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you? \" He looked like the overly helpful,chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to lookat me. \"Where's your next class? \" he asked. I had to check in my bag. \"Um, Government, with Jefferson, in buildingsix. \"There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes. \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way…\" Definitelyover-helpful. \"I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively. \"Thanks. \"We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. Icould have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough toeavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh? \" he asked. \"Very. \"\"It doesn't rain much there, does it? \"\"Three or four times a year. \"\"Wow, what must that be like? \" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan. \"\"My mother is part albino. \"He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like cloudsand a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget howto use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle. \"Maybe we'll have\fsome other classes together. \" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside. The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometryteacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of thesubject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of theclass and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my ownboots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in eachclass. There was always someone braver than the others who wouldintroduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. Itried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I neverneeded the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with meto the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than myfive feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot ofthe difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so Ismiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn'ttry to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who sheintroduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy fromEnglish, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation withseven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from whereI sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren'ttalking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray ofuntouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike mostof the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear ofmeeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of thesethings that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big — muscledlike a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller,leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, lessbulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than theothers, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers hererather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had abeautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustratedswimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit onher self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden,gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike,thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black,cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale,the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler thanme, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hairtones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes — purplish, bruiselikeshadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almostdone recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all theirfeatures, were straight, perfect, angular. But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were alldevastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected tosee except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Orpainted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decidewho was the most beautiful — maybe the perfect blond girl, or thebronze-haired boy. They were all looking away — away from each other, away from the other\fstudents, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As Iwatched, the small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda, unbittenapple — and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on arunway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped hertray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thoughtpossible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they? \" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'dforgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant — though already knowing, probably,from my tone — suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyishone, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fractionof a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine."

She was tiny, several inches shorter than myfive feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot ofthe difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so Ismiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn'ttry to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who sheintroduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy fromEnglish, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation withseven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from whereI sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren'ttalking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray ofuntouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike mostof the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear ofmeeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of thesethings that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big — muscledlike a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller,leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, lessbulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than theothers, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers hererather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had abeautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustratedswimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit onher self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden,gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike,thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black,cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale,the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler thanme, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hairtones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes — purplish, bruiselikeshadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almostdone recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all theirfeatures, were straight, perfect, angular. But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were alldevastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected tosee except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Orpainted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decidewho was the most beautiful — maybe the perfect blond girl, or thebronze-haired boy. They were all looking away — away from each other, away from the other\fstudents, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As Iwatched, the small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda, unbittenapple — and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on arunway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped hertray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thoughtpossible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they? \" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'dforgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant — though already knowing, probably,from my tone — suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyishone, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fractionof a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine."

                "text": "He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush ofembarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance,his face held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called his name,and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not toanswer. My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did. \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The onewho left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and hiswife. \" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now,picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was movingvery quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three stilllooked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I finally rememberedthat my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There weretwo girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are… very nice-looking. \" I struggled with the conspicuousunderstatement. \"Yes! \" Jessica agreed with another giggle. \"They're all together though —Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they livetogether. \" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the smalltown, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admitthat even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens? \" I asked. \"They don't look related…\"\"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or earlythirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins —the blondes — and they're foster children. \"\"They look a little old for foster children. \"\"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've beenwith Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or somethinglike that. \"\"That's really kind of nice — for them to take care of all those kidslike that, when they're so young and everything. \"\"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression thatshe didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glancesshe was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reasonwas jealousy. \"I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" sheadded, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again tothe table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at thewalls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks? \" I asked. Surely I would have noticed\fthem on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to anew arrival like me. \"They just moved down two years ago from somewherein Alaska. \"I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as theywere, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't theonly newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by anystandard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and metmy gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I lookedswiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmetexpectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair? \" I asked. I peeked athim from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but notgawking like the other students had today — he had a slightly frustratedexpression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. Hedoesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enoughfor him. \" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'dturned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face wasturned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he weresmiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. Theyall were noticeably graceful — even the big, brawny one. It wasunsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would haveif I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on myfirst day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded methat her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walkedto class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped labtable exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. Infact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, Irecognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that singleopen seat. As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get myslip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, hesuddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyeswith the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious. Ilooked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book inthe walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girlsitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense aboutintroductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he hadno choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by theantagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but Isaw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning awayfrom me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his facelike he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. Itsmelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed aninnocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making adark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd alreadystudied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of myhair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he neverrelaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far fromme as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into afist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he neverrelaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to hiselbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath hislight skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burlybrother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because theday was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tightfist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked likehe wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normalbehavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunchtoday. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought. It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve. I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring downat me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away fromhim, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenlyran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullenwas out of his seat. Fluidly he rose — he was much taller than I'dthought — his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else wasout of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. Itwasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block theanger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, mytemper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry,a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan? \" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefullygelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviouslydidn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike. \"\"Hi, Mike. \"\"Do you need any help finding your next class? \"\"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it. \"\"That's my next class, too. \" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't thatbig of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he supplied most of theconversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till hewas ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in myEnglish class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab EdwardCullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that. \"I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently,that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology? \" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said. \"He looked like he was in pain or something. \"\"I don't know,\" I responded. \"I never spoke to him. \"\f\"He's a weird guy. \" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to thedressing room. \"If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talkedto you. \"I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. Hewas friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease myirritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dressdown for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P. E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personalhell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering howmany injuries I had sustained — and inflicted — playing volleyball, Ifelt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return mypaperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, andcolder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walkedback out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again thattousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to befree. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked upthe gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biologyto another time — any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be somethingelse, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The lookon his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It wasimpossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense disliketo me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through theroom, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in thewire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened,and he turned slowly to glare at me — his face was absurdly handsome —with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill ofgenuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second,but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to thereceptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet. \"I can seethat it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help. \" And he turned onhis heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, andhanded her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear? \" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemedlike a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp greenhole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key andthe engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fightingtears the whole way there. Chapter 2 Open Book\n    The next day was better… and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were denseand opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day."

Then I glanced at him again. His face wasturned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he weresmiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. Theyall were noticeably graceful — even the big, brawny one. It wasunsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would haveif I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on myfirst day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded methat her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walkedto class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped labtable exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. Infact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, Irecognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that singleopen seat. As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get myslip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, hesuddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyeswith the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious. Ilooked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book inthe walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girlsitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense aboutintroductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he hadno choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by theantagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but Isaw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning awayfrom me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his facelike he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. Itsmelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed aninnocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making adark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd alreadystudied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of myhair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he neverrelaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far fromme as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into afist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he neverrelaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to hiselbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath hislight skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burlybrother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because theday was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tightfist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked likehe wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normalbehavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunchtoday. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought. It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve. I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring downat me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away fromhim, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenlyran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullenwas out of his seat. Fluidly he rose — he was much taller than I'dthought — his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else wasout of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. Itwasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block theanger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, mytemper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry,a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan? \" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefullygelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviouslydidn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike. \"\"Hi, Mike. \"\"Do you need any help finding your next class? \"\"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it. \"\"That's my next class, too. \" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't thatbig of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he supplied most of theconversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till hewas ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in myEnglish class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab EdwardCullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that. \"I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently,that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology? \" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said. \"He looked like he was in pain or something. \"\"I don't know,\" I responded. \"I never spoke to him. \"\f\"He's a weird guy. \" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to thedressing room. \"If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talkedto you. \"I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. Hewas friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease myirritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dressdown for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P. E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personalhell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering howmany injuries I had sustained — and inflicted — playing volleyball, Ifelt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return mypaperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, andcolder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walkedback out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again thattousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to befree. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked upthe gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biologyto another time — any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be somethingelse, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The lookon his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It wasimpossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense disliketo me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through theroom, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in thewire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened,and he turned slowly to glare at me — his face was absurdly handsome —with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill ofgenuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second,but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to thereceptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet. \"I can seethat it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help. \" And he turned onhis heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, andhanded her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear? \" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemedlike a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp greenhole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key andthe engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fightingtears the whole way there. Chapter 2 Open Book\n    The next day was better… and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were denseand opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day."

                "text": "It was colder thismorning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomedseat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It wasstraightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought Iwould feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected tofeel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at mycheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said. \"It's snowing. \"I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along thesidewalk and swirling erratically past my face. \"Ew. \" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised. \"Don't you like snow? \"\"No. That means it's too cold for rain. \" Obviously. \"Besides, I thoughtit was supposed to come down in flakes — you know, each one unique andall that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips. \"\"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before? \" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have. \" I paused. \"On TV. \"Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked intothe back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had mysuspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us — in thewrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay? \" I kept walking as I spoke. \"Once peoplestart throwing wet stuff, I go inside. \"He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow;apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouthshut. Sure, it was drier than rain — until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush ballswere flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as ashield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in myexpression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with icemelting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedlyabout the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward thattable in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. Therewere five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want? \"I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious,I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella? \" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered. \"I'll just get a soda today. \" I caught up to theend of the line. \"Aren't you hungry? \" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table,my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, withunnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up andescape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away. I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If hewas glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them werelooking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hairentirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning awayas Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying thesnowy day, just like everyone else — only they looked more like a scenefrom a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was somethingdifferent, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. Iexamined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided —flushed from the snow fight maybe — the circles under his eyes much lessnoticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying toisolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at? \" Jessica intruded, her eyes following mystare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure,though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh orunfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curiousagain, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he? \" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question. \"Should he be? \"\"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put myhead down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody… well, they don't notice anybody enoughto like them. But he's still staring at you. \"\"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make surethat she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then — he was planning an epic battle of the blizzardin the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreedenthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that shewould be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have tohide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my owntable. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since hedidn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightenedlittle flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual — he seemed tobe a popular target for the snowball snipers — but when we went to thedoor, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing alltraces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of thewalkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to gostraight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was stillempty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing onemicroscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a fewminutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away fromthe door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayedcarefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as faraway from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. Hishair was dripping wet, disheveled — even so, he looked like he'd justfinished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face wasfriendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes werecareful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued. \"I didn't have a chance tointroduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan. \"My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? Hewas perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn'tthink of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name? \" I stammered. He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting foryou to arrive. \"I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly. \"I meant, why did you call me Bella? \"He seemed confused. \"Do you prefer Isabella? \"\"No, I like Bella,\" I said. \"But I think Charlie — I mean my dad — mustcall me Isabella behind my back — that's what everyone here seems to knowme as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh. \" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly. Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried toconcentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slidesin the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separatethe slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis theyrepresented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use ourbooks. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had itright. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner? \" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling acrooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish. \" The smile faded; he was obviouslywondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing. \"I'll go ahead. \"I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knewwhat I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide intoplace under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident. \"Prophase. \"\"Do you mind if I look? \" he asked as I began to remove the slide. Hishand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold,like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn'twhy I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung myhand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, hecontinued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, ashe examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on ourworksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, andthen glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke. I kept my voice indifferent. \"May I? \"He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it,he was right. \"Slide three? \" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch myskin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase. \" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. Hetook a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it whilehe looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want tospoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and hispartner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had theirbook open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him…unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that sameinexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified thatsubtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts? \" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question. \"No. \"\"Oh,\" I mumbled. \"I thought there was something different about youreyes. \"He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered\fthe flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me — thecolor was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburnhair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher,darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn'tunderstand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason aboutthe contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense ofthe word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. Helooked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then staredmore intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with themicroscope? \" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically. \"Actually, she identified threeof the five. \"Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before? \" he asked. I smiled sheepishly. \"Not with onion root. \"\"Whitefish blastula? \"\"Yeah. \"Mr. Banner nodded. \"Were you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix? \"\"Yes. \"\"Well,\" he said after a moment, \"I guess it's good you two are labpartners. \" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, Ibegan doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it? \" Edward asked. I had the feelingthat he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia sweptover me again."

His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenlysympathetic. \"When did that happen? \"\"Last September. \" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough. \"\"Why didn't you stay with them? \"I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me withpenetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitallyimportant. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living. \" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him? \" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He movesaround a lot. \"\"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him. \" Hesaid it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction. \"No, she did not send me here. I sent myself. \"His eyebrows knit together. \"I don't understand,\" he admitted, and heseemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at mewith obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy… soI decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie. \" My voicewas glum by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out. \"And? \" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair. \" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor. \"Hasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair. \"\"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at methat way. His gaze became appraising. \"You put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyonesee. \"I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like afive-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong? \"I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured smugly. \"Why does it matter to you? \" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away,watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered ifhe was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, Idecided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you? \" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking… and told the truth again. \"Notexactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read — mymother always calls me her open book. \" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read. \" Despite everythingthat I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually. \" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief tolisten. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to thisbizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemedengrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of myeye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edgeof the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, withtransparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen withoutdifficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefullyfrom the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I staredafter him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imaginedhim with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned. \"They all looked exactly the same. You'relucky you had Cullen for a partner. \"\"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. Iregretted the snub instantly. \"I've done the lab before, though,\" I addedbefore he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged intoour raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent. \"I wonder what was with him last Monday. \"I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so mywoolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my teamducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I washappier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once notcaring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket,put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dryit on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed thestill, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door ofthe Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting arusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on thebrake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrapmetal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of mycar, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I staredstraight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I wouldswear I saw him laughing. Chapter 3 Phenomenon\n    When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different. It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day inthe forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fogveiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, andwhitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain fromyesterday had frozen solid — coating the needles on the trees infantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it mightbe safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways,living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myselfreveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from thecarton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew itwasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeingmy new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I waseager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that wasvery, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassingbabbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie abouthis eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes feltemanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured hisperfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheresthat did not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brickdriveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck,but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, todaywas going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and myunwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike andEric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to mehere. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe itwas just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through allthe awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few andfar between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearingrather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever thereason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with himwere disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored. My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered theroads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path ofdestruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so littletrouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of thetruck — carefully holding the side for support — to examine my tires. There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, andCharlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise. I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight backthe sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heardan odd sound. It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. Ilooked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion,the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed tomake my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detailseveral things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me inhorror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the samemask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue vanthat was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes,spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hitthe back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn'teven have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around thetruck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I wasexpecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt somethingsolid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavementbehind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance tonotice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curledgratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding,was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice wasimpossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectivelyin front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, thelarge hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of thevan's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly grippingunder the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging mylegs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. Agroaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping,onto the asphalt — exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low,frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right? \"\"I'm fine. \" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized hewas holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head prettyhard. \"I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"Ow,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought. \" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he wassuppressing laughter. \"How in the…\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?"

Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging— a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was.

As I reached for it, hedropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air. \"\"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant. \" Hisvoice was quiet as usual — velvet, muted.

My palms tingled — I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised atmyself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and startedto walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. Buthe was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm notsaying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway. \"\"Why won't you leave me alone? \" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. Heseemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder? \" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again. \"I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask? \"\"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday — you know, the day of thespring dance —\"\"Are you trying to be funny? \" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. Myface got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish? \"I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so Icouldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wonderingif you wanted a ride. \"That was unexpected. \"What? \" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle? \"\"With who? \" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously. \" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talkingto someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why? \"\"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to behonest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it. \"\"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern. \" Istarted to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same levelof anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas? \" He matched my paceagain. \"I don't see how that is any of your business. \" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business. \"\"Honestly, Edward. \" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, andI hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be myfriend. \"\"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't wantto be. \"\"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up. \" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I hadstopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roofnow, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't helpmy clarity of thought. \"It would be more… prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained. \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella. \"His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, hisvoice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle? \" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned."

His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish? \"I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so Icouldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wonderingif you wanted a ride. \"That was unexpected. \"What? \" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle? \"\"With who? \" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously. \" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talkingto someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why? \"\"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to behonest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it. \"\"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern. \" Istarted to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same levelof anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas? \" He matched my paceagain. \"I don't see how that is any of your business. \" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business. \"\"Honestly, Edward. \" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, andI hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be myfriend. \"\"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't wantto be. \"\"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up. \" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I hadstopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roofnow, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't helpmy clarity of thought. \"It would be more… prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained. \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella. \"His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, hisvoice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle? \" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned."

                "text": "So it was going to be one of those days. At least Mike was happy to see me. \"You came! \" he called, delighted. \"And I said it would be sunny today,didn't I? \"\"I told you I was coming,\" I reminded him. \"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha… unless you invited someone,\"Mike added. \"Nope,\" I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the lie. But alsowishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied. \"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan. \"\"Sure. \"He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. \"You can have shotgun,\" he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't assimple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could seeJessica glowering at us now. The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people,and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in betweenMike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been moregraceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, densegreen forests edging the road most of the way and the wide QuillayuteRiver snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We'drolled the windows down — the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with ninepeople in it — and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible. I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summerswith Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar tome. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in thesunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands roseout of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to unevensummits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only athin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew intomillions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from adistance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta,sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn withhuge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piledtogether against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, justout of reach of the waves. There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicansfloated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment,but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring ofdriftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Ericand the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwoodfrom the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had ateepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders. \"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire? \" Mike asked me. I was sitting onone of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossipingexcitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting oneof the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter. \"No,\" I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee. \"You'll like this then — watch the colors. \" He lit another small branchand laid it alongside the first. The flames started to lick quickly upthe dry wood. \"It's blue,\" I said in surprise. \"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it? \" He lit one more piece, placed itwhere the fire hadn't yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully,Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention. I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to thenearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tidepools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of theonly things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On theother hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you'reseven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request — that I notfall into the ocean. Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike,and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the othergirls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. Iwaited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before Igot up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smilewhen he saw that I was coming. The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescentlaughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banteraround me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding rootsbelow and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I brokethrough the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shoreagain. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way tothe sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completelydrained were teeming with life. I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. Theothers were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously onthe edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of thelargest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the naturalaquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulatedceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about theedges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to therocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripeswove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I wascompletely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wonderedwhat Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be sayingif he were here with me. Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. Itried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally I fella few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of myjeans were stained green, but it could have been worse. When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind hadmultiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight blackhair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation\fcome to socialize. The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim ashare while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, Inoticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at mein interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwichesand an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be theoldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others withhim. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, andthe boy who noticed me was named Jacob. It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person tobe around — she didn't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinkingabout how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur attimes, with single images standing out more clearly than others. Andthen, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. Iknew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky,darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across thebeach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people startedto drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of thewaves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others weregathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike — with Jessicashadowing him — headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of thelocal kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the timethey all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, withLauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone hadthought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched aroundthe circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who hadacted as spokesperson. A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over totake her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and hadlong, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of hisneck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes weredark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had justa hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a verypretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by thefirst words out of his mouth. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you? \"It was like the first day of school all over again. \"Bella,\" I sighed. \"I'm Jacob Black. \" He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. \"Youbought my dad's truck. \"\"Oh,\" I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. \"You're Billy's son. Iprobably should remember you. \"\"No, I'm the youngest of the family — you would remember my oldersisters. \"\"Rachel and Rebecca,\" I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrownus together a lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. Wewere all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, I'd kickedup enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven. \"Are they here? \" I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if Iwould recognize them now. \"No. \" Jacob shook his head. \"Rachel got a scholarship to WashingtonState, and Rebecca married a Samoan surfer — she lives in Hawaii now. \"\"Married. Wow. \" I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a yearolder than I was. \"So how do you like the truck? \" he asked. \"I love it. It runs great. \"\"Yeah, but it's really slow,\" he laughed. \"I was so relived when Charliebought it. My dad wouldn't let me work on building another car when wehad a perfectly good vehicle right there. \"\"It's not that slow,\" I objected. \"Have you tried to go over sixty? \"\"No,\" I admitted. \"Good. Don't. \" He grinned. I couldn't help grinning back. \"It does great in a collision,\" I offeredin my truck's defense. \"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,\" he agreed withanother laugh. \"So you build cars? \" I asked, impressed. \"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where Icould get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit? \" headded jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. \"Sorry,\" I laughed, \"I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyesopen for you. \" As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I waslearning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who noticed. \"You know Bella, Jacob? \" Lauren asked — in what I imagined was aninsolent tone — from across the fire. \"We've sort of known each other since I was born,\" he laughed, smiling atme again. \"How nice. \" She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and herpale, fishy eyes narrowed. \"Bella,\" she called again, watching my face carefully, \"I was just sayingto Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them? \" Her expression of concern wasunconvincing. \"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family? \" the tall, older boy asked beforeI could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to aman than a boy, and his voice was very deep. \"Yes, do you know them? \" she asked condescendingly, turning halfwaytoward him. \"The Cullens don't come here,\" he said in a tone that closed the subject,ignoring her question. Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CDhe held. She was distracted. I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking awaytoward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't comehere, but his tone had implied something more — that they weren'tallowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression onme, and I tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. \"So is Forks driving you insane yet? \"\"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement. \" I grimaced. He grinnedunderstandingly. I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had asudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn't have any betterideas."

Wow. \" I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a yearolder than I was. \"So how do you like the truck? \" he asked. \"I love it. It runs great. \"\"Yeah, but it's really slow,\" he laughed. \"I was so relived when Charliebought it. My dad wouldn't let me work on building another car when wehad a perfectly good vehicle right there. \"\"It's not that slow,\" I objected. \"Have you tried to go over sixty? \"\"No,\" I admitted. \"Good. Don't. \" He grinned. I couldn't help grinning back. \"It does great in a collision,\" I offeredin my truck's defense. \"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,\" he agreed withanother laugh. \"So you build cars? \" I asked, impressed. \"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where Icould get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit? \" headded jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. \"Sorry,\" I laughed, \"I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyesopen for you. \" As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I waslearning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who noticed. \"You know Bella, Jacob? \" Lauren asked — in what I imagined was aninsolent tone — from across the fire. \"We've sort of known each other since I was born,\" he laughed, smiling atme again. \"How nice. \" She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and herpale, fishy eyes narrowed. \"Bella,\" she called again, watching my face carefully, \"I was just sayingto Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them? \" Her expression of concern wasunconvincing. \"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family? \" the tall, older boy asked beforeI could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to aman than a boy, and his voice was very deep. \"Yes, do you know them? \" she asked condescendingly, turning halfwaytoward him. \"The Cullens don't come here,\" he said in a tone that closed the subject,ignoring her question. Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CDhe held. She was distracted. I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking awaytoward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't comehere, but his tone had implied something more — that they weren'tallowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression onme, and I tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. \"So is Forks driving you insane yet? \"\"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement. \" I grimaced. He grinnedunderstandingly. I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had asudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn't have any betterideas."

He'd been here and gone before your people had evenarrived. \" He was fighting a smile. \"And what are they? \" I finally asked. \"What are the cold ones? \"He smiled darkly. \"Blood drinkers,\" he replied in a chilling voice. \"Your people call themvampires. \"I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face\fwas exposing. \"You have goose bumps,\" he laughed delightedly. \"You're a good storyteller,\" I complimented him, still staring into thewaves. \"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want usto talk about it to anyone. \"I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. \"Don't worry,I won't give you away. \"\"I guess I just violated the treaty,\" he laughed. \"I'll take it to the grave,\" I promised, and then I shivered. \"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad atmy dad when he heard that some of us weren't going to the hospital sinceDr. Cullen started working there. \"\"I won't, of course not. \"\"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what? \" heasked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn't lookedaway from the ocean. I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could. \"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I stillhave goose bumps, see? \" I held up my arm. \"Cool. \" He smiled. And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each otherwarned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the sametime to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us. \"There you are, Bella,\" Mike called in relief, waving his arm over hishead. \"Is that your boyfriend? \" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge inMike's voice. I was surprised it was so obvious. \"No, definitely not,\" I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob,and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefullyturning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting. \"So when I get my license…\" he began. \"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime. \" I feltguilty as I said this, knowing that I'd used him. But I really did likeJacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could seehis eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth. \"Where have you been? \" he asked, though the answer was right in front ofhim. \"Jacob was just telling me some local stories,\" I volunteered. \"It wasreally interesting. \"I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. \"Well,\" Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watchedour camaraderie. \"We're packing up — it looks like it's going to rainsoon. \"We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. \"Okay. \" I jumped up. \"I'm coming. \"\f\"It was nice to see you again,\" Jacob said, and I could tell he wastaunting Mike just a bit. \"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come,too,\" I promised. His grin stretched across his face. \"That would be cool. \"\"And thanks,\" I added earnestly. I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parkinglot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stoneswhere they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were alreadyloading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela andTyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Laurentwisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I couldsimply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hardnot to think. Chapter 7 Nightmare\n    I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't wantanything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excitedabout, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so hewasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I foundmy old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I pickedup a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of hisfavorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for mytastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on theheadphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. Iclosed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow overthe top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand thelyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'dlistened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least. I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once Igot past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again. And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think —which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD againand again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally,I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of myconsciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of theforest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewherenearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tuggingon my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong? \" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked withall his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run! \" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella! \" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomyheart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why? \" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now tofind the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to thedim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror. \"Jacob! \" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brownwolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward theshore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growlsissuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run! \" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. Iwas watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, hiseyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come tohim. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth weresharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire,fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No! \" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off thebedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor."

No wonder my dad doesn't want usto talk about it to anyone. \"I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. \"Don't worry,I won't give you away. \"\"I guess I just violated the treaty,\" he laughed. \"I'll take it to the grave,\" I promised, and then I shivered. \"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad atmy dad when he heard that some of us weren't going to the hospital sinceDr. Cullen started working there. \"\"I won't, of course not. \"\"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what? \" heasked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn't lookedaway from the ocean. I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could. \"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I stillhave goose bumps, see? \" I held up my arm. \"Cool. \" He smiled. And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each otherwarned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the sametime to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us. \"There you are, Bella,\" Mike called in relief, waving his arm over hishead. \"Is that your boyfriend? \" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge inMike's voice. I was surprised it was so obvious. \"No, definitely not,\" I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob,and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefullyturning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting. \"So when I get my license…\" he began. \"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime. \" I feltguilty as I said this, knowing that I'd used him. But I really did likeJacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could seehis eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth. \"Where have you been? \" he asked, though the answer was right in front ofhim. \"Jacob was just telling me some local stories,\" I volunteered. \"It wasreally interesting. \"I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. \"Well,\" Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watchedour camaraderie. \"We're packing up — it looks like it's going to rainsoon. \"We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. \"Okay. \" I jumped up. \"I'm coming. \"\f\"It was nice to see you again,\" Jacob said, and I could tell he wastaunting Mike just a bit. \"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come,too,\" I promised. His grin stretched across his face. \"That would be cool. \"\"And thanks,\" I added earnestly. I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parkinglot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stoneswhere they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were alreadyloading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela andTyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Laurentwisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I couldsimply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hardnot to think. Chapter 7 Nightmare\n    I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't wantanything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excitedabout, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so hewasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I foundmy old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I pickedup a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of hisfavorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for mytastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on theheadphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. Iclosed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow overthe top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand thelyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'dlistened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least. I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once Igot past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again. And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think —which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD againand again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally,I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of myconsciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of theforest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewherenearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tuggingon my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong? \" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked withall his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run! \" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella! \" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomyheart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why? \" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now tofind the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to thedim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror. \"Jacob! \" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brownwolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward theshore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growlsissuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run! \" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. Iwas watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, hiseyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come tohim. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth weresharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire,fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No! \" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off thebedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor."

                "text": "My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, withmy shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It wasfive-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled backover and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried tostay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortableridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped therubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. Ipulled the pillow back over my eyes. It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly theimages I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have toface them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long aspossible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Eventaking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do inthe bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn'ttell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went tolook out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed — somethingI never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk andswitched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my freeservice substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to goget myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed thebowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as Iclimbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off thefloor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled outthe headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned thesame CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise. With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen wascovered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closingall the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite searchengine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up,there was a lot to sift through — everything from movies and TV shows torole-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site — Vampires A—Z. I waited impatiently for itto load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished — simple white background with blacktext, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page:\n　　Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figureso terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with suchfearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nordemon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysteriousand terrible qualities of both. — Rev. Montague SummersIf there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of thevampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-knownpeople, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof ismost complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? — RousseauThe rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the differentmyths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, theDanag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro onthe islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked withhumans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cuther finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much thatit drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything thatsounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire mythscentered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; theyalso seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortalityrates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Manyof the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improperburials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, andonly a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who wereeven preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, apowerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinnedhuman, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it couldmassacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and oneother, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence. Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side ofgoodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds thatclaimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories ormy own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd readand carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, paleskin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers,enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very fewmyths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small numberof scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading —vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to acinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waitingto shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelmingembarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room,researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of theblame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks — and the entiresodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go thatdidn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclearwhere I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoatwithout checking the weather and stomped out the door. It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started easton foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroachingforest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and theroad to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the dampearth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or Iwouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction washopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trailwound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I couldtell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews andthe maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and allI knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser windowin earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't besure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. Asthat started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down fromthe canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning torain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in theleaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recentlyfallen tree — I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted inmoss — rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating asheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped overthe ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the dampseat and my clothes wherever they touched, and leaned my hooded head backagainst the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but whereelse was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like thescene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that therewas no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it mustbe raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I wasseated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away,and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities thatembarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousandsof years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different landsseemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cutbedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer,but I did so unwillingly. First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said aboutthe Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was sillyand morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I askedmyself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at thismoment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: theimpossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold\fand back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more —small things that registered slowly — how they never seemed to eat, thedisturbing grace with which they moved. And the way besometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit thestyle of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-centuryclassroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn'tsaid no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed toknow what everyone around him was thinking… except me. He had told me hewas the villain, dangerous…Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rationaljustification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whetherit be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen wasnot… human. He was something more. So then — maybe. That would have to be my answer for now. And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if itwas true? If Edward was a vampire — I could hardly make myself think the words —then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. Icouldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed. Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: tobe smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to goback to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was animpenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we wereforced together. To tell him to leave me alone — and mean it this time. I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered thatalternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the nextoption. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something… sinister,he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent inTyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued withmyself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex tosave lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around inanswerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The darkEdward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of theword Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamedout in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf thatbrought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed —even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was achoice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew — if I knew —I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought ofhim, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of hispersonality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Evenif… but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Notwhile the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered likefootsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quicklyfrom my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would havedisappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the drippinggreen maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face,becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I hadcome."

I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed — somethingI never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk andswitched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my freeservice substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to goget myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed thebowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as Iclimbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off thefloor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled outthe headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned thesame CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise. With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen wascovered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closingall the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite searchengine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up,there was a lot to sift through — everything from movies and TV shows torole-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site — Vampires A—Z. I waited impatiently for itto load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished — simple white background with blacktext, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page:\n　　Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figureso terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with suchfearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nordemon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysteriousand terrible qualities of both. — Rev. Montague SummersIf there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of thevampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-knownpeople, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof ismost complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? — RousseauThe rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the differentmyths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, theDanag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro onthe islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked withhumans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cuther finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much thatit drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything thatsounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire mythscentered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; theyalso seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortalityrates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Manyof the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improperburials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, andonly a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who wereeven preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, apowerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinnedhuman, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it couldmassacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and oneother, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence. Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side ofgoodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds thatclaimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories ormy own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd readand carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, paleskin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers,enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very fewmyths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small numberof scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading —vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to acinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waitingto shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelmingembarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room,researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of theblame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks — and the entiresodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go thatdidn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclearwhere I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoatwithout checking the weather and stomped out the door. It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started easton foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroachingforest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and theroad to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the dampearth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or Iwouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction washopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trailwound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I couldtell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews andthe maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and allI knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser windowin earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't besure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. Asthat started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down fromthe canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning torain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in theleaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recentlyfallen tree — I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted inmoss — rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating asheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped overthe ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the dampseat and my clothes wherever they touched, and leaned my hooded head backagainst the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but whereelse was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like thescene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that therewas no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it mustbe raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I wasseated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away,and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities thatembarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousandsof years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different landsseemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cutbedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer,but I did so unwillingly. First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said aboutthe Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was sillyand morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I askedmyself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at thismoment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: theimpossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold\fand back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more —small things that registered slowly — how they never seemed to eat, thedisturbing grace with which they moved. And the way besometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit thestyle of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-centuryclassroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn'tsaid no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed toknow what everyone around him was thinking… except me. He had told me hewas the villain, dangerous…Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rationaljustification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whetherit be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen wasnot… human. He was something more. So then — maybe. That would have to be my answer for now. And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if itwas true? If Edward was a vampire — I could hardly make myself think the words —then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. Icouldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed. Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: tobe smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to goback to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was animpenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we wereforced together. To tell him to leave me alone — and mean it this time. I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered thatalternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the nextoption. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something… sinister,he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent inTyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued withmyself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex tosave lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around inanswerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The darkEdward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of theword Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamedout in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf thatbrought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed —even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was achoice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew — if I knew —I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought ofhim, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of hispersonality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Evenif… but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Notwhile the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered likefootsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quicklyfrom my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would havedisappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the drippinggreen maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face,becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I hadcome."

                "text": "I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. Iran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinnerwould be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out ofhis boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet — I fell asleep outside. \" I stifled ayawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on thegame, anyway. \"I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn'tanything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so heturned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemedhappy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despitemy depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to lookat dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted\fme to help them choose… do you mind if I go with them? \"\"Jessica Stanley? \" he asked. \"And Angela Weber. \" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right? \"\"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses — you know, giving themconstructive criticism. \" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay. \" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with thegirlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though. \"\"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okayfor dinner, right? \"\"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" hereminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly,\"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top. \"It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that Igrimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blueV-neck blouse — something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix. I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make itto class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for aspace, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly notthere. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arrivingbreathless, but subdued, before the final bell. It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn't keep little sprouts ofhope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as Isearched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all themore attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I wasanxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder,hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. Ivowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruinAngela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do alittle clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might beshopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in theearlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least tellingme. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that Icould ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when Iwas inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated gettingout of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining againwhere to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to apurse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela'shouse next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increasedexponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits. Chapter 8 Port Angeles\n    Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a girls' night out, and the estrogenrush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessicajabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mikehad gone very well, and she was hoping that by Saturday night they would\fhave progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not reallyinterested in Eric. Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was,but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to spareher. Angela threw a grateful glance my way. Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished andquaint than Forks. But Jessica and Angela knew it well, so they didn'tplan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess drovestraight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streetsin from the bay area's visitor-friendly face. The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what thatmeant. Both Jessica and Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelievingwhen I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix. \"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something? \" Jess asked dubiouslyas we walked through the front doors of the store. \"Really,\" I tried to convince her, not wanting to confess my dancingproblems. \"I've never had a boyfriend or anything close. I didn't go outmuch. \"\"Why not? \" Jessica demanded. \"No one asked me,\" I answered honestly. She looked skeptical. \"People ask you out here,\" she reminded me, \"andyou tell them no. \" We were in the juniors' section now, scanning theracks for dress-up clothes. \"Well, except for Tyler,\" Angela amended quietly. \"Excuse me? \" I gasped. \"What did you say? \"\"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom,\" Jessica informed me withsuspicious eyes. \"He said what? \" I sounded like I was choking. \"I told you it wasn't true,\" Angela murmured to Jessica. I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and now we had work to do. \"That's why Lauren doesn't like you,\" Jessica giggled while we pawedthrough the clothes. I ground my teeth. \"Do you think that if I ran him over with my truck hewould stop feeling guilty about the accident? That he might give up onmaking amends and call it even? \"\"Maybe,\" Jess snickered. '\"If that's why he's doing this. \"The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things totry on. I sat on a low chair just inside the dressing room, by thethree-way mirror, trying to control my fuming. Jess was torn between two — one a long, strapless, basic black number,the other a knee-length electric blue with spaghetti straps. I encouragedher to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose a palepink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honeytints in her light brown hair. I complimented them both generously andhelped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole process wasmuch shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Renée at home. I guess there was something to be said for limited choices. We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on Imerely watched and critiqued, not in the mood to shop for myself, thoughI did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the wakeof my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in. \"Angela? \" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a pair of pinkstrappy heels — she was overjoyed to have a date tall enough that shecould wear high heels at all. Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone. \"Yes? \" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a better view ofthe shoe. I chickened out. \"I like those. \"\"I think I'll get them — though they'll never match anything but the onedress,\" she mused. \"Oh, go ahead — they're on sale,\" I encouraged. She smiled, putting thelid back on a box that contained more practical-looking off-white shoes. I tried again. \"Um, Angela…\" She looked up curiously. \"Is it normal for the… Cullens\" — I kept my eyes on the shoes — \"to beout of school a lot? \" I failed miserably in my attempt to soundnonchalant. \"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time — eventhe doctor. They're all real outdoorsy,\" she told me quietly, examiningher shoes, too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the hundreds thatJessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela. \"Oh. \" I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us therhinestone jewelry she'd found to match her silver shoes. We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on theboardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and thenwalk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant inan hour — I wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing tocome with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun — they didn't know howpreoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something Ipreferred to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, andI headed in the direction Jess pointed out. I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was lookingfor. The windows were full of crystals, dream-catchers, and books aboutspiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I could seea fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back,clad in a dress right out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behindthe counter. I decided that was one conversation I could skip. There hadto be a normal bookstore in town. I meandered through the streets, which were filling up withend-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was headed toward downtown. Iwasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I waswrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, andwhat Angela had said… and more than anything trying to beat down my hopesfor Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when Ilooked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and itall came crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought tomyself. I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shopsthat looked promising. But when I got to them, they were just a repairshop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking for Jessand Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before Imet back up with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of timesand took some deep breaths before I continued around the corner. I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going thewrong direction. The little foot traffic I had seen was going north, andit looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided toturn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks andtry my luck on a different street on my way back to the boardwalk. A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressedtoo casually to be heading home from the office, but they were too grimyto be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they weren't too manyyears older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves,laughing raucously and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far tothe inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking swiftly,looking past them to the corner. \"Hey, there! \" one of them called as they passed, and he had to be talkingto me since no one else was around. I glanced up automatically. Two ofthem had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a heavyset,dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who hadspoken. He was wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-offjeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me. \"Hello,\" I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away andwalked faster toward the corner. I could hear them laughing at fullvolume behind me. \"Hey, wait! \" one of them called after me again, but I kept my head downand rounded the corner with a sigh of relief. I could still hear themchortling behind me. I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of severalsomber-colored warehouses, each with large bay doors for unloadingtrucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had nosidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting somekind of engine parts storage yard. I'd wandered far past the part of PortAngeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, Irealized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon,creating an early sunset. The eastern sky was still clear, but graying,shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in thecar, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. Asingle van passed me, and then the road was empty. The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder toglare at the offending cloud, I realized with a shock that two men werewalking quietly twenty feet behind me."

Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out ofhis boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet — I fell asleep outside. \" I stifled ayawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on thegame, anyway. \"I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn'tanything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so heturned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemedhappy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despitemy depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to lookat dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted\fme to help them choose… do you mind if I go with them? \"\"Jessica Stanley? \" he asked. \"And Angela Weber. \" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right? \"\"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses — you know, giving themconstructive criticism. \" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay. \" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with thegirlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though. \"\"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okayfor dinner, right? \"\"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" hereminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly,\"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top. \"It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that Igrimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blueV-neck blouse — something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix. I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make itto class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for aspace, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly notthere. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arrivingbreathless, but subdued, before the final bell. It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn't keep little sprouts ofhope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as Isearched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all themore attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I wasanxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder,hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. Ivowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruinAngela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do alittle clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might beshopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in theearlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least tellingme. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that Icould ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when Iwas inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated gettingout of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining againwhere to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to apurse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela'shouse next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increasedexponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits. Chapter 8 Port Angeles\n    Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a girls' night out, and the estrogenrush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessicajabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mikehad gone very well, and she was hoping that by Saturday night they would\fhave progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not reallyinterested in Eric. Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was,but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to spareher. Angela threw a grateful glance my way. Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished andquaint than Forks. But Jessica and Angela knew it well, so they didn'tplan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess drovestraight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streetsin from the bay area's visitor-friendly face. The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what thatmeant. Both Jessica and Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelievingwhen I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix. \"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something? \" Jess asked dubiouslyas we walked through the front doors of the store. \"Really,\" I tried to convince her, not wanting to confess my dancingproblems. \"I've never had a boyfriend or anything close. I didn't go outmuch. \"\"Why not? \" Jessica demanded. \"No one asked me,\" I answered honestly. She looked skeptical. \"People ask you out here,\" she reminded me, \"andyou tell them no. \" We were in the juniors' section now, scanning theracks for dress-up clothes. \"Well, except for Tyler,\" Angela amended quietly. \"Excuse me? \" I gasped. \"What did you say? \"\"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom,\" Jessica informed me withsuspicious eyes. \"He said what? \" I sounded like I was choking. \"I told you it wasn't true,\" Angela murmured to Jessica. I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and now we had work to do. \"That's why Lauren doesn't like you,\" Jessica giggled while we pawedthrough the clothes. I ground my teeth. \"Do you think that if I ran him over with my truck hewould stop feeling guilty about the accident? That he might give up onmaking amends and call it even? \"\"Maybe,\" Jess snickered. '\"If that's why he's doing this. \"The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things totry on. I sat on a low chair just inside the dressing room, by thethree-way mirror, trying to control my fuming. Jess was torn between two — one a long, strapless, basic black number,the other a knee-length electric blue with spaghetti straps. I encouragedher to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose a palepink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honeytints in her light brown hair. I complimented them both generously andhelped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole process wasmuch shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Renée at home. I guess there was something to be said for limited choices. We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on Imerely watched and critiqued, not in the mood to shop for myself, thoughI did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the wakeof my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in. \"Angela? \" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a pair of pinkstrappy heels — she was overjoyed to have a date tall enough that shecould wear high heels at all. Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone. \"Yes? \" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a better view ofthe shoe. I chickened out. \"I like those. \"\"I think I'll get them — though they'll never match anything but the onedress,\" she mused. \"Oh, go ahead — they're on sale,\" I encouraged. She smiled, putting thelid back on a box that contained more practical-looking off-white shoes. I tried again. \"Um, Angela…\" She looked up curiously. \"Is it normal for the… Cullens\" — I kept my eyes on the shoes — \"to beout of school a lot? \" I failed miserably in my attempt to soundnonchalant. \"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time — eventhe doctor. They're all real outdoorsy,\" she told me quietly, examiningher shoes, too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the hundreds thatJessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela. \"Oh. \" I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us therhinestone jewelry she'd found to match her silver shoes. We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on theboardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and thenwalk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant inan hour — I wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing tocome with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun — they didn't know howpreoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something Ipreferred to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, andI headed in the direction Jess pointed out. I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was lookingfor. The windows were full of crystals, dream-catchers, and books aboutspiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I could seea fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back,clad in a dress right out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behindthe counter. I decided that was one conversation I could skip. There hadto be a normal bookstore in town. I meandered through the streets, which were filling up withend-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was headed toward downtown. Iwasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I waswrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, andwhat Angela had said… and more than anything trying to beat down my hopesfor Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when Ilooked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and itall came crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought tomyself. I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shopsthat looked promising. But when I got to them, they were just a repairshop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking for Jessand Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before Imet back up with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of timesand took some deep breaths before I continued around the corner. I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going thewrong direction. The little foot traffic I had seen was going north, andit looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided toturn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks andtry my luck on a different street on my way back to the boardwalk. A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressedtoo casually to be heading home from the office, but they were too grimyto be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they weren't too manyyears older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves,laughing raucously and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far tothe inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking swiftly,looking past them to the corner. \"Hey, there! \" one of them called as they passed, and he had to be talkingto me since no one else was around. I glanced up automatically. Two ofthem had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a heavyset,dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who hadspoken. He was wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-offjeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me. \"Hello,\" I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away andwalked faster toward the corner. I could hear them laughing at fullvolume behind me. \"Hey, wait! \" one of them called after me again, but I kept my head downand rounded the corner with a sigh of relief. I could still hear themchortling behind me. I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of severalsomber-colored warehouses, each with large bay doors for unloadingtrucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had nosidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting somekind of engine parts storage yard. I'd wandered far past the part of PortAngeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, Irealized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon,creating an early sunset. The eastern sky was still clear, but graying,shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in thecar, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. Asingle van passed me, and then the road was empty. The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder toglare at the offending cloud, I realized with a shock that two men werewalking quietly twenty feet behind me."

                "text": "They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neitherwas the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once,quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather mademe shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slungacross my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't getsnatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was — still in my dufflebag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, justa twenty and some ones, and I thought about \"accidentally\" dropping mybag and walking away. But a small, frightened voice in the back of mymind warned me that they might be something worse than thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quietwhen compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and itdidn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. Icontinued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running,focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from menow. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A bluecar turned onto the street from the south and drove quickly past me. Ithought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsurethat I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only ablind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned inanticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrowdrive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, wherethere was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me,deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and Iknew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and gosprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitelyfarther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they weremaybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staringat me. It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pacesteady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind withevery step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I sawtwo cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and Iexhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off thisdeserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh. And skidded to a stop. The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two intersections down, streetlamps, cars,and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because loungingagainst the western building, midway down the street, were the other twomen from the group, both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead onthe sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being followed. I was being herded. I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turnedthen and darted to the other side of the road. I had a sinking feelingthat it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now. \"There you are! \" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired manshattered the intense quiet and made me jump. In the gathering darkness,it seemed like he was looking past me. \"Yeah,\" a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as Itried to hurry down the street. \"We just took a little detour. \"My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself andthe lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud scream, and I sucked inair, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how muchvolume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over myhead, gripping the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use itas weapon as need demanded. The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop,and walked slowly into the street. \"Stay away from me,\" I warned in a voice that was supposed to soundstrong and fearless. But I was right about the dry throat — no volume. \"Don't be like that, sugar,\" he called, and the raucous laughter startedagain behind me. I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic whatlittle self-defense I knew. Heel of the hand thrust upward, hopefullybreaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eyesocket — try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee tothe groin, of course. That same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke upthen, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance against one ofthem, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terrorcould incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent scream. Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting thestocky one, forcing him to jump back toward the sidewalk. I dove into theroad — this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver carunexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passengerdoor open just a few feet from me. \"Get in,\" a furious voice commanded. It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing howsuddenly the feeling of security washed over me — even before I was offthe street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into the seat,slamming the door shut behind me. It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of thedoor, and I could barely see his face in the glow from the dashboard. Thetires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly,\fswerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of themdiving for the sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. \"Put on your seat belt,\" he commanded, and I realized I was clutching theseat with both hands. I quickly obeyed; the snap as the belt connectedwas loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, blowingthrough several stop signs without a pause. But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned aboutwhere we were going. I stared at his face in profound relief, relief thatwent beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in thelimited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until itoccurred to me that his expression was murderously angry. \"Are you okay? \" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. \"No,\" he said curtly, and his tone was livid. I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes staredstraight ahead, until the car came to a sudden stop. I glanced around,but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of darktrees crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore. \"Bella? \" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. \"Yes? \" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. \"Are you all right? \" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plainon his face. \"Yes,\" I croaked softly. \"Distract me, please,\" he ordered. \"I'm sorry, what? \"He exhaled sharply. \"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,\" heclarified, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose with histhumb and forefinger. \"Um. \" I wracked my brain for something trivial. \"I'm going to run overTyler Crowley tomorrow before school? \"He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner of his mouthtwitched. \"Why? \"\"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom — either he's insaneor he's still trying to make up for almost killing me last… well, youremember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this. SoI figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keeptrying to make amends. I don't need enemies and maybe Lauren would backoff if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If hedoesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom…\" I babbled on. \"I heard about that. \" He sounded a bit more composed. \"You did? \" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. \"If he'sparalyzed from the neck down, he can't go to the prom, either,\" Imuttered, refining my plan. Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes. \"Better? \"\"Not really. \"I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against theseat, staring at the ceiling of the car. His face was rigid. \"What's wrong? \" My voice came out in a whisper. \"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella. \" He was whispering,too, and as he stared out the window, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"Butit wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down those…\" Hedidn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment tocontrol his anger again. \"At least,\" he continued, \"that's what I'mtrying to convince myself. \"\"Oh. \" The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a betterresponse. We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It waspast six-thirty. \"Jessica and Angela will be worried,\" I murmured. \"I was supposed to meetthem. \"He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly andspeeding back toward town. We were under the streetlights in no time atall, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars slowlycruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space Iwould have thought much too small for the Volvo, but he slid ineffortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of LaBella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously awayfrom us. \"How did you know where… ? \" I began, but then I just shook my head. Iheard the door open and turned to see him getting out. \"What are you doing? \" I asked. \"I'm taking you to dinner. \" He smiled slightly, but his eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and slammed the door. I fumbled with my seatbelt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was waiting forme on the sidewalk. He spoke before I could. \"Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have totrack them down, too. I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran intoyour other friends again. \"I shivered at the threat in his voice. \"Jess! Angela! \" I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushedback to me, the pronounced relief on both their faces simultaneouslychanging to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. Theyhesitated a few feet from us. \"Where have you been? \" Jessica's voice was suspicious. \"I got lost,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"And then I ran into Edward. \" Igestured toward him. \"Would it be all right if I joined you? \" he asked in his silken,irresistible voice. I could see from their staggered expressions that hehad never unleashed his talents on them before. \"Er… sure,\" Jessica breathed. \"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting — sorry,\"Angela confessed. \"That's fine — I'm not hungry. \" I shrugged. \"I think you should eat something. \" Edward's voice was low, but full ofauthority. He looked up at Jessica and spoke slightly louder. \"Do youmind if I drive Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait whileshe eats. \"\"Uh, no problem, I guess…\" She bit her lip, trying to figure out from myexpression whether that was what I wanted. I winked at her. I wanted\fnothing more than to be alone with my perpetual savior. There were somany questions that I couldn't bombard him with till we were by ourselves. \"Okay. \" Angela was quicker than Jessica. \"See you tomorrow, Bella…Edward. \" She grabbed Jessica's hand and pulled her toward the car, whichI could see a little ways away, parked across First Street. As they gotin, Jess turned and waved, her face eager with curiosity. I waved back,waiting for them to drive away before I turned to face him. \"Honestly, I'm not hungry,\" I insisted, looking up to scrutinize hisface. His expression was unreadable. \"Humor me. \"He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with anobstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion. Iwalked past him into the restaurant with a resigned sigh. The restaurant wasn't crowded — it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female, and I understood the look in her eyes as sheassessed Edward. She welcomed him a little more warmly than necessary. Iwas surprised by how much that bothered me. She was several inches tallerthan I was, and unnaturally blond. \"A table for two? \" His voice was alluring, whether he was aiming for thator not. I saw her eyes flicker to me and then away, satisfied by myobvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward keptbetween us. She led us to a table big enough for four in the center ofthe most crowded area of the dining floor."

                "text": "They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neitherwas the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once,quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather mademe shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slungacross my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't getsnatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was — still in my dufflebag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, justa twenty and some ones, and I thought about \"accidentally\" dropping mybag and walking away. But a small, frightened voice in the back of mymind warned me that they might be something worse than thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quietwhen compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and itdidn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. Icontinued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running,focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from menow. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A bluecar turned onto the street from the south and drove quickly past me. Ithought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsurethat I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only ablind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned inanticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrowdrive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, wherethere was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me,deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and Iknew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and gosprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitelyfarther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they weremaybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staringat me. It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pacesteady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind withevery step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I sawtwo cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and Iexhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off thisdeserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh. And skidded to a stop. The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two intersections down, streetlamps, cars,and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because loungingagainst the western building, midway down the street, were the other twomen from the group, both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead onthe sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being followed. I was being herded. I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turnedthen and darted to the other side of the road. I had a sinking feelingthat it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now. \"There you are! \" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired manshattered the intense quiet and made me jump. In the gathering darkness,it seemed like he was looking past me. \"Yeah,\" a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as Itried to hurry down the street. \"We just took a little detour. \"My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself andthe lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud scream, and I sucked inair, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how muchvolume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over myhead, gripping the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use itas weapon as need demanded. The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop,and walked slowly into the street. \"Stay away from me,\" I warned in a voice that was supposed to soundstrong and fearless. But I was right about the dry throat — no volume. \"Don't be like that, sugar,\" he called, and the raucous laughter startedagain behind me. I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic whatlittle self-defense I knew. Heel of the hand thrust upward, hopefullybreaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eyesocket — try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee tothe groin, of course. That same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke upthen, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance against one ofthem, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terrorcould incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent scream. Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting thestocky one, forcing him to jump back toward the sidewalk. I dove into theroad — this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver carunexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passengerdoor open just a few feet from me. \"Get in,\" a furious voice commanded. It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing howsuddenly the feeling of security washed over me — even before I was offthe street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into the seat,slamming the door shut behind me. It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of thedoor, and I could barely see his face in the glow from the dashboard. Thetires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly,\fswerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of themdiving for the sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. \"Put on your seat belt,\" he commanded, and I realized I was clutching theseat with both hands. I quickly obeyed; the snap as the belt connectedwas loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, blowingthrough several stop signs without a pause. But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned aboutwhere we were going. I stared at his face in profound relief, relief thatwent beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in thelimited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until itoccurred to me that his expression was murderously angry. \"Are you okay? \" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. \"No,\" he said curtly, and his tone was livid. I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes staredstraight ahead, until the car came to a sudden stop. I glanced around,but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of darktrees crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore. \"Bella? \" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. \"Yes? \" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. \"Are you all right? \" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plainon his face. \"Yes,\" I croaked softly. \"Distract me, please,\" he ordered. \"I'm sorry, what? \"He exhaled sharply. \"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,\" heclarified, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose with histhumb and forefinger. \"Um. \" I wracked my brain for something trivial. \"I'm going to run overTyler Crowley tomorrow before school? \"He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner of his mouthtwitched. \"Why? \"\"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom — either he's insaneor he's still trying to make up for almost killing me last… well, youremember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this. SoI figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keeptrying to make amends. I don't need enemies and maybe Lauren would backoff if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If hedoesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom…\" I babbled on. \"I heard about that. \" He sounded a bit more composed. \"You did? \" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. \"If he'sparalyzed from the neck down, he can't go to the prom, either,\" Imuttered, refining my plan. Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes. \"Better? \"\"Not really. \"I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against theseat, staring at the ceiling of the car. His face was rigid. \"What's wrong? \" My voice came out in a whisper. \"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella. \" He was whispering,too, and as he stared out the window, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"Butit wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down those…\" Hedidn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment tocontrol his anger again. \"At least,\" he continued, \"that's what I'mtrying to convince myself. \"\"Oh. \" The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a betterresponse. We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It waspast six-thirty. \"Jessica and Angela will be worried,\" I murmured. \"I was supposed to meetthem. \"He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly andspeeding back toward town. We were under the streetlights in no time atall, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars slowlycruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space Iwould have thought much too small for the Volvo, but he slid ineffortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of LaBella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously awayfrom us. \"How did you know where… ? \" I began, but then I just shook my head. Iheard the door open and turned to see him getting out. \"What are you doing? \" I asked. \"I'm taking you to dinner. \" He smiled slightly, but his eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and slammed the door. I fumbled with my seatbelt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was waiting forme on the sidewalk. He spoke before I could. \"Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have totrack them down, too. I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran intoyour other friends again. \"I shivered at the threat in his voice. \"Jess! Angela! \" I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushedback to me, the pronounced relief on both their faces simultaneouslychanging to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. Theyhesitated a few feet from us. \"Where have you been? \" Jessica's voice was suspicious. \"I got lost,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"And then I ran into Edward. \" Igestured toward him. \"Would it be all right if I joined you? \" he asked in his silken,irresistible voice. I could see from their staggered expressions that hehad never unleashed his talents on them before. \"Er… sure,\" Jessica breathed. \"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting — sorry,\"Angela confessed. \"That's fine — I'm not hungry. \" I shrugged. \"I think you should eat something. \" Edward's voice was low, but full ofauthority. He looked up at Jessica and spoke slightly louder. \"Do youmind if I drive Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait whileshe eats. \"\"Uh, no problem, I guess…\" She bit her lip, trying to figure out from myexpression whether that was what I wanted. I winked at her. I wanted\fnothing more than to be alone with my perpetual savior. There were somany questions that I couldn't bombard him with till we were by ourselves. \"Okay. \" Angela was quicker than Jessica. \"See you tomorrow, Bella…Edward. \" She grabbed Jessica's hand and pulled her toward the car, whichI could see a little ways away, parked across First Street. As they gotin, Jess turned and waved, her face eager with curiosity. I waved back,waiting for them to drive away before I turned to face him. \"Honestly, I'm not hungry,\" I insisted, looking up to scrutinize hisface. His expression was unreadable. \"Humor me. \"He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with anobstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion. Iwalked past him into the restaurant with a resigned sigh. The restaurant wasn't crowded — it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female, and I understood the look in her eyes as sheassessed Edward. She welcomed him a little more warmly than necessary. Iwas surprised by how much that bothered me. She was several inches tallerthan I was, and unnaturally blond. \"A table for two? \" His voice was alluring, whether he was aiming for thator not. I saw her eyes flicker to me and then away, satisfied by myobvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward keptbetween us. She led us to a table big enough for four in the center ofthe most crowded area of the dining floor."

The sun was finallysetting, and I was about to get out and follow you on foot. And then —\"He stopped, clenching his teeth together in sudden fury. He made aneffort to calm himself. \"Then what? \" I whispered. He continued to stare over my head. \"I heard what they were thinking,\" he growled, his upper lip curlingslightly back over his teeth. \"I saw your face in his mind. \" He suddenlyleaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his hand covering hiseyes. The movement was so swift it startled me. \"It was very… hard — you can't imagine how hard — for me to simply takeyou away, and leave them… alive. \" His voice was muffled by his arm. \"Icould have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I was afraid if youleft me alone, I would go looking for them,\" he admitted in a whisper. I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in mylap, and I was leaning weakly against the back of the seat. He still hadhis face in his hand, and he was as still as if he'd been carved from thestone his skin resembled. Finally he looked up, his eyes seeking mine, full of his own questions. \"Are you ready to go home? \" he asked. \"I'm ready to leave,\" I qualified, overly grateful that we had thehour-long ride home together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to him. The waitress appeared as if she'd been called. Or watching. \"How are we doing? \" she asked Edward. \"We're ready for the check, thank you. \" His voice was quiet, rougher,still reflecting the strain of our conversation. It seemed to muddle her. He looked up, waiting. \"S-sure,\" she stuttered. \"Here you go. \" She pulled a small leather folderfrom the front pocket of her black apron and handed it to him. There was a bill in his hand already. He slipped it into the folder andhanded it right back to her. \"No change. \" He smiled. Then he stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to myfeet. She smiled invitingly at him again. \"You have a nice evening. \"He didn't look away from me as he thanked her. I suppressed a smile. He walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. Iremembered what Jessica had said about her relationship with Mike, howthey were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward seemed to hearme, and he looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful thathe didn't seem to be able to know what I was thinking. He opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shuttingit softly behind me. I watched him walk around the front of the car,amazed, yet again, by how graceful he was. I probably should have beenused to that by now — but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the\fkind of person anyone got used to. Once inside the car, he started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I guessed the good weather was at an end. Iwas warm in his jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it when Ithought he couldn't see. Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance,flipping around to head toward the freeway. \"Now,\" he said significantly, \"it's your turn. \"\n\nChapter 9 Theory\n    \"Can I ask just one more? \" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much tooquickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attentionto the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well… you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I hadgone south. I was just wondering how you knew that. \"He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent. \" He looked at the road, giving metime to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response tothat, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explainingthings. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions…\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one? \"\"How does it work — the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind,anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family… ? \" I felt silly,asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingersand gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairlyclose. The more familiar someone's… 'voice' is, the farther away I canhear them. But still, no more than a few miles. \" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyonetalking at once. It's just a hum — a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \"Most of the time I tune it all out — it can be very distracting. Andthen it's easier to seem normal\" — he frowned as he said the word — \"whenI'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than theirwords. \"\"Why do you think you can't hear me? \" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your\fmind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughtsare on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM. \" He grinned at me,suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak? \" The words bothered me morethan they should — probably because his speculation hit home. I'd alwayssuspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" helaughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory…\" His face tightened. \"Whichbrings us back to you. \"I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now? \" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. Ihappened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow! \" I shouted. \"Slow down! \"\"What's wrong? \" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour! \" I was still shouting. I shot apanicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The roadwas only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from theheadlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall— as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella. \" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us? \" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash. \"I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry? \"\"I always drive like this. \" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road! \"\"I've never been in an accident, Bella — I've never even gotten aticket. \" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector. \"\"Very funny. \" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abideby traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around atree trunk, you can probably just walk away. \"\"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't. \" Hesighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted towardeighty. \"Happy? \"\"Almost. \"\"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow? \"\"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting foryour latest theory. \"I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me. \"\"Is it that bad? \"\"Pretty much, yeah. \"He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his\fexpression. \"Go ahead. \" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning… you said you didn't come up withthis on your own. \"\"No. \"\"What got you started — a book? A movie? \" he probed. \"No — it was Saturday, at the beach. \" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend —Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad andCharlie have been friends since I was a baby. \"He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders. \" I watched him carefully. Hisconfused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk —\" I edited allmy scheming out of the story \"— and he was telling me some old legends —trying to scare me, I think. He told me one…\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires. \" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at hisface now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me? \" Still calm. \"No. He… mentioned your family. \"He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn'texpect me to think anything of it. \" It didn't seem like enough; I had toconfess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me. \"\"Why? \"\"Lauren said something about you — she was trying to provoke me. And anolder boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation,only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob aloneand I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head. He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but hiseyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how? \" he asked. \"I tried to flirt — it worked better than I thought it would. \" Disbeliefcolored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that. \" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me ofdazzling people — poor Jacob Black. \"I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then? \" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet. \"\"And did that convince you? \" His voice sounded barely interested. But hishands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then…\" I stopped. \"What? \"\"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter? \" His tone made me look up — I had finally brokenthrough his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with justa hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are. \"A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human! \"\"No. \"He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything. \"\"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather knowwhat you're thinking — even if what you're thinking is insane. \"\"So I'm wrong again? \" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'! \" he quoted,gritting his teeth together. \"I'm right? \" I gasped. \"Does it matter? \"I took a deep breath. \"Not really. \" I paused. \"But I am curious. \" My voice, at least, wascomposed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about? \"\"How old are you? \"\"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen? \"His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted atlast. \"Okay. \" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. Hestared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he wasworried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and hefrowned. \"Don't laugh — but how can you come out during the daytime? \"He laughed anyway. \"Myth. \"\"Burned by the sun? \"\"Myth. \"\"Sleeping in coffins? \"\"Myth. \" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep. \"It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all? \"\"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at mewith a wistful expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my trainof thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet. \" His voice was\fhard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold."

The sun was finallysetting, and I was about to get out and follow you on foot. And then —\"He stopped, clenching his teeth together in sudden fury. He made aneffort to calm himself. \"Then what? \" I whispered. He continued to stare over my head. \"I heard what they were thinking,\" he growled, his upper lip curlingslightly back over his teeth. \"I saw your face in his mind. \" He suddenlyleaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his hand covering hiseyes. The movement was so swift it startled me. \"It was very… hard — you can't imagine how hard — for me to simply takeyou away, and leave them… alive. \" His voice was muffled by his arm. \"Icould have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I was afraid if youleft me alone, I would go looking for them,\" he admitted in a whisper. I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in mylap, and I was leaning weakly against the back of the seat. He still hadhis face in his hand, and he was as still as if he'd been carved from thestone his skin resembled. Finally he looked up, his eyes seeking mine, full of his own questions. \"Are you ready to go home? \" he asked. \"I'm ready to leave,\" I qualified, overly grateful that we had thehour-long ride home together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to him. The waitress appeared as if she'd been called. Or watching. \"How are we doing? \" she asked Edward. \"We're ready for the check, thank you. \" His voice was quiet, rougher,still reflecting the strain of our conversation. It seemed to muddle her. He looked up, waiting. \"S-sure,\" she stuttered. \"Here you go. \" She pulled a small leather folderfrom the front pocket of her black apron and handed it to him. There was a bill in his hand already. He slipped it into the folder andhanded it right back to her. \"No change. \" He smiled. Then he stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to myfeet. She smiled invitingly at him again. \"You have a nice evening. \"He didn't look away from me as he thanked her. I suppressed a smile. He walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. Iremembered what Jessica had said about her relationship with Mike, howthey were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward seemed to hearme, and he looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful thathe didn't seem to be able to know what I was thinking. He opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shuttingit softly behind me. I watched him walk around the front of the car,amazed, yet again, by how graceful he was. I probably should have beenused to that by now — but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the\fkind of person anyone got used to. Once inside the car, he started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I guessed the good weather was at an end. Iwas warm in his jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it when Ithought he couldn't see. Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance,flipping around to head toward the freeway. \"Now,\" he said significantly, \"it's your turn. \"\n\nChapter 9 Theory\n    \"Can I ask just one more? \" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much tooquickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attentionto the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well… you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I hadgone south. I was just wondering how you knew that. \"He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent. \" He looked at the road, giving metime to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response tothat, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explainingthings. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions…\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one? \"\"How does it work — the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind,anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family… ? \" I felt silly,asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingersand gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairlyclose. The more familiar someone's… 'voice' is, the farther away I canhear them. But still, no more than a few miles. \" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyonetalking at once. It's just a hum — a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \"Most of the time I tune it all out — it can be very distracting. Andthen it's easier to seem normal\" — he frowned as he said the word — \"whenI'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than theirwords. \"\"Why do you think you can't hear me? \" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your\fmind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughtsare on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM. \" He grinned at me,suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak? \" The words bothered me morethan they should — probably because his speculation hit home. I'd alwayssuspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" helaughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory…\" His face tightened. \"Whichbrings us back to you. \"I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now? \" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. Ihappened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow! \" I shouted. \"Slow down! \"\"What's wrong? \" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour! \" I was still shouting. I shot apanicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The roadwas only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from theheadlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall— as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella. \" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us? \" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash. \"I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry? \"\"I always drive like this. \" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road! \"\"I've never been in an accident, Bella — I've never even gotten aticket. \" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector. \"\"Very funny. \" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abideby traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around atree trunk, you can probably just walk away. \"\"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't. \" Hesighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted towardeighty. \"Happy? \"\"Almost. \"\"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow? \"\"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting foryour latest theory. \"I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me. \"\"Is it that bad? \"\"Pretty much, yeah. \"He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his\fexpression. \"Go ahead. \" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning… you said you didn't come up withthis on your own. \"\"No. \"\"What got you started — a book? A movie? \" he probed. \"No — it was Saturday, at the beach. \" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend —Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad andCharlie have been friends since I was a baby. \"He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders. \" I watched him carefully. Hisconfused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk —\" I edited allmy scheming out of the story \"— and he was telling me some old legends —trying to scare me, I think. He told me one…\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires. \" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at hisface now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me? \" Still calm. \"No. He… mentioned your family. \"He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn'texpect me to think anything of it. \" It didn't seem like enough; I had toconfess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me. \"\"Why? \"\"Lauren said something about you — she was trying to provoke me. And anolder boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation,only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob aloneand I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head. He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but hiseyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how? \" he asked. \"I tried to flirt — it worked better than I thought it would. \" Disbeliefcolored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that. \" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me ofdazzling people — poor Jacob Black. \"I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then? \" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet. \"\"And did that convince you? \" His voice sounded barely interested. But hishands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then…\" I stopped. \"What? \"\"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter? \" His tone made me look up — I had finally brokenthrough his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with justa hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are. \"A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human! \"\"No. \"He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything. \"\"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather knowwhat you're thinking — even if what you're thinking is insane. \"\"So I'm wrong again? \" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to.

He said your family wasn't supposed tobe dangerous because you only hunted animals. \"\"He said we weren't dangerous? \" His voice was deeply skeptical. \"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But theQuileutes still didn't want you on their land, just in case. \"He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. \"So was he right? About not hunting people? \" I tried to keep my voice aseven as possible. \"The Quileutes have a long memory,\" he whispered. I took it as a confirmation. \"Don't let that make you complacent, though,\" he warned me. \"They'reright to keep their distance from us. We are still dangerous. \"\"I don't understand. \"\"We try,\" he explained slowly. \"We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. Me, for example, allowing myself to be alonewith you. \"\"This is a mistake? \" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't knowif he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curvesof the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like avideo game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like theblack road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never haveanother chance to be with him like this again — openly, the walls betweenus gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from theidea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so Icould hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more doyou want to know? \"\"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voicestill tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I foughtagainst the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster. \" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough? \"He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living ontofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger — or rather thirst. But it keensus strong enough to resist. Most of the time. \" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others. \"\"Is it very difficult for you now? \" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes. \"\"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently — stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that? \"\"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people — men inparticular — are crabbier when they're hungry. \"He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you? \"I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing itto memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett? \" I asked when it was quietagain. \"Yes. \" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to saysomething. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a biteasier to be around you when I'm not thirsty. \"\"Why didn't you want to leave? \"\"It makes me… anxious… to be away from you. \" His eyes were gentle butintense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn'tjoking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run overlast Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. Andafter what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through awhole weekend unscathed. \" He shook his head, and then seemed to remembersomething. \"Well, not totally unscathed. \"\"What? \"\"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at thealmost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missednothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought. \" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose,being you, it could have been much worse — and that possibility tormentedme the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I reallygot on Emmett's nerves. \" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today? \"\"No, we got back Sunday. \"\"Then why weren't any of you in school? \" I was frustrated, almost angryas I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of hisabsence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go outin the sunlight — at least, not where anyone can see. \"\"Why? \"\"I'll show you sometime,\" he promised. I thought about it for a moment. \"You might have called me,\" I decided. He was puzzled. \"But I knew you were safe. \"\"But I didn't know where you were. I —\" I hesitated, dropping my eyes. \"What? \" His velvety voice was compelling. \"I didn't like it. Not seeing you.

It's one thing for me to make myself miserable,but a wholly other thing for you to be so involved. \" He turned hisanguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me tounderstand. \"I don't want to hear that you feel that way. \" His voice waslow but urgent. His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'mdangerous, Bella — please, grasp that. \"\"No. \" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late. \"His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that. \"I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I staredout at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast. \"What are you thinking? \" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook myhead, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but Ikept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying? \" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture inmy eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, andsure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me. \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then hestopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry. \" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't justapologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear himstruggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes? \"\"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? Icouldn't understand your expression — you didn't look that scared, youlooked like you were concentrating very hard on something. \"\"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker — you know,self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain. \" I thought ofthe dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them? \" This upset him. \"Didn't you think aboutrunning? \"\"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help? \"\"I was getting to that part. \"He shook his head. \"You were right — I'm definitely fighting fate tryingto keep you alive. \"\fI sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It hadtaken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow? \" I demanded. \"Yes — I have a paper due, too. \" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat atlunch. \"It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that littlepromise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in itsplace, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. Hestopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow? \"\"I promise. \"I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off,taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it — you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie. \"\"Oh, right. \" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella? \" he asked in a different tone — serious, but hesitant. \"Yes? \" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something? \"\"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. Whatif he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone. \"I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why? \"He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it atthat. \"I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I wasrelieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever yousay. \"\"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then. \" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella? \" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious facejust inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It wasthe same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a moreconcentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. ThenI stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to becertain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard hisengine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around thecorner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella? \"\"Yeah, Dad, it's me. \" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseballgame. \"You're home early. \"\"Am I? \" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun? \"\"Yeah — it was lots of fun. \" My head was spinning as I tried to rememberall the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both founddresses. \"\"Are you all right? \"\"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking. \"\"Well, maybe you should go lie down. \" He sounded concerned. I wonderedwhat my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first. \"\"Weren't you just with her? \" he asked, surprised. \"Yes — but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings ittomorrow. \"\"Well, give her a chance to get home first. \"\"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was reallyfeeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello? \" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella? \"\"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you. \"\"You made it home? \" Her voice was relieved… and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car — could you bring it to me tomorrow? \"\"Sure. But tell me what happened! \" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow — in Trig, okay? \"She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there? \"\"Yes, that's right. \"\"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye! \" I could hear the impatiencein her voice. \"Bye, Jess. \"I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I wentthrough the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attentionto what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower — the water toohot, burning my skin — that I realized I was freezing. I shudderedviolently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finallyrelax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move,until the hot water began to run out."

                "text": "I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold theheat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressedfor bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, huggingmyself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, andsome I fought to repress. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fellgradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was avampire. Second, there was part of him — and I didn't know how potentthat part might be — that thirsted for my blood. And third, I wasunconditionally and irrevocably in love with him. Chapter 10 Interrogations\n    It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that wassure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. Iclung to the parts I couldn't have imagined — like his smell. I was sureI could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had noreason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes,remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again — I was running later thanI'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it downwith milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist wasice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. Icouldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fogthat I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a carin it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked upagain in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling thedoor open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today? \" he asked, amused by my expression ashe caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice — I was free to refuse, and part of himhoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped intothe warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of thepassenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should bepossible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick orsomething. \" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jackethimself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again,the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossaltribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto mylap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if thescent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you? \" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meantfor me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feelingawkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down… almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left metongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today? \"\"Do my questions bother you? \" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do. \" He looked like he was joking, but Icouldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly? \"\"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly — it's unnatural. It makes me wonder what you're really thinking. \"\"I always tell you what I'm really thinking. \"\"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much. \"\"Enough to drive me insane. \"\"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as thewords were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; Icould only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face wasunreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred tome belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family? \" I asked — more than glad to be alonewith him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car. \" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy redconvertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it? \"\"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you? \"\"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in. \"\"You don't succeed. \" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of thecar. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to schoolin plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's moreconspicuous? \"\"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now. \" He met me at thefront of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but Iwas afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all? \" I wondered aloud. \"If you'relooking for privacy? \"\"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drivefast. \"\"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting,her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, wasmy jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks forremembering. \" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his faultthat his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of. \"Er… hi. \" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbledthoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig. \" She gave me a meaningful look,and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then. \"She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her? \" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind! \" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers — she'll be waiting to ambush you in class. \"I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing itwith my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her? \"\"A little help? \" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know? \"He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair. \"\"No, you not sharing what you know — now that's not fair. \"He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door tomy first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know howyou feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say? \" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I wasbarely aware of them. \"Hmmm. \" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping thetwist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart splutteredhyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first… if you don'tmind — it's easier than any other explanation. \"\"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question… well, I'll be listening to hear theanswer to that one myself. \" One side of his mouth pulled up into myfavorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respondto that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three peoplewalking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now Iwas even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat inmy usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to seean odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles? \"\"It was…\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finishedlamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress. \"\"Did she say anything about Monday night? \" he asked, his eyesbrightening. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did? \" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely. \"Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in ourpapers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worriedabout how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether Edwardwould really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess'sthoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be — when it\fwasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the daywas still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sittingin the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantlywent to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to getit over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything! \" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know? \" I hedged. \"What happened last night? \"\"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home. \"She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you gethome so fast? \"\"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying. \" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date — did you tell him to meet you there? \"I hadn't thought of that. \"No — I was very surprised to see him there. \"Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in myvoice. \"But he picked you up for school today? \" she probed. \"Yes — that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket lastnight,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again? \"\"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truckisn't up to it — does that count? \"\"Yes. \" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes. \"\"W-o-w. \" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen. \"\"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait! \" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you? \"\"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that. \"She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday… ? \" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it. \" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about? \" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and weweren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked aboutthe English essay a little. \" A very, very little. I think he mentioned itin passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details. \"\"Well… okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirtingwith him — it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her atall. \" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty? \"\"Very — and probably nineteen or twenty. \"\"Even better. He must like you. \"\"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw infor his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why? \" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so… intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him. \" She made aface, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turnedthe overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous. \" Jessica shrugged as if thisexcused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that. \"\"Really? Like what? \"I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd beenkidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right… but he's even more unbelievable behind theface."

I wouldn'thave helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried aboutthe subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shovingmy books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tippedJessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you? \" she guessed. \"I don't think so. \" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappearinconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall —looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to — Edward waswaiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella. \" Her voice was thick with implications. I mighthave to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello. \" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had beenlistening, it was obvious. \"Hi. \"I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak — bidinghis time, I presumed — so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walkingwith Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my firstday here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyesreturned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. Itseemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as thedominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on myjacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing? \" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me? \"He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course. \"I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From theother end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazementas we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in myhands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food? \"\"You're always curious. \" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me,holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, anddeliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. Iwatched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you? \" he askedcondescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once… on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't sobad. \"He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised. \" Something over my shoulderseemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do — she'll break it down for youlater. \" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessicabrought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowinghe was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she? \" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice? \"\"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind. \"\"Poor girl. \" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica… well, it bothers me. \" He refused to bedistracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lasheswith troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know whatthey say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening. \"\"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking. \"\"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren'tprecisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking —everything. I just wish… that you wouldn't be thinking some things. \"I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction. \"\"But that's not really the point at the moment. \"\"Then what is? \" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, myright hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were ina crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was tooeasy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you? \" hemurmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came backto me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What? \"\"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh. \" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it. \"\"Are you going to answer the question? \"I looked down. \"Yes. \"\"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that? \" He wasirritated again. \"Yes, I really think that. \" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyestracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. Thesilence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it thistime, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong. \"I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head indoubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly tobelieve them. \"What makes you think so? \" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating —trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to findsome way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him gettingimpatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted myhand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he wassatisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table,moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared atmy hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes…\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure— I don't know how to read minds — but sometimes it seems like you'retrying to say goodbye when you're saying something else. \" That was thebest I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered inme at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing ashe confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he beganto explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'? \"\"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'mabsolutely ordinary — well, except for bad things like all the near-deathexperiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look atyou. \" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took ona knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'lladmit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but youdidn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on yourfirst day. \"I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it…\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once — you are the opposite of ordinary. \"My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that cameinto his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my originalargument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because ifI can do it\" — he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought —\"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep fromhurting you, to keep you safe. \"I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same? \"\"You'd never have to make the choice. \"Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous,devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safeis beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires myconstant presence. \"\"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful forthe lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. IfI had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keephim close… I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on myface. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to beexpecting disasters. \"I have another question for you. \" His face was still casual. \"Shoot. \"\"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just anexcuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers? \"\fI made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for theTyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deludedhimself into thinking I'm going to prom with him. \"\"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me — I just reallywanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if hislaughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turnedme down? \" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later — faked anillness or a sprained ankle. \"He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that? \"I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I wouldhave thought you would understand. \"\"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stablesurface without finding something to trip over? \"\"Obviously. \"\"That wouldn't be a problem. \" He was very confident. \"It's all in theleading. \" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me — are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do youmind if we do something different? \"As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask. \"He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What? \"\"Can I drive? \"He frowned. \"Why? \"\"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, hespecifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If heasked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will askagain, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subjectunnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me. \"He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you,you worry about my driving. \" He shook his head in disgust, but then hiseyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you'respending the day with me? \" There was an undercurrent to his question thatI didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more. \" I was definite about that. \"Whereare we going, anyway? \"\"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye… andyou can stay with me, if you'd like to. \" Again, he was leaving the choiceup to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun? \" I asked, excited bythe idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes. \" He smiled, and then paused."

I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. \"So you like him, then? \" She wasn't about to give up. \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \"I mean, do you really like him? \" she urged. \"Yes,\" I said again, blushing.

But I don't see howI can help that. \" I sighed, one blush blending into the next. Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, andas soon as the bell rang, I took evasive action. \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" Itold her. \"You're kidding!

I wouldn'thave helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried aboutthe subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch.

But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall —looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to — Edward waswaiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella. \" Her voice was thick with implications. I mighthave to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello. \" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had beenlistening, it was obvious. \"Hi. \"I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak — bidinghis time, I presumed — so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walkingwith Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my firstday here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyesreturned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. Itseemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as thedominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on myjacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing? \" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me? \"He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course. \"I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From theother end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazementas we sat across from each other.

The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly,back to him, and I. asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend… to hunt? Charliesaid it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears. \"He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears? \" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" Iadded sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" heinformed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears? \" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite. \" His voice was still offhand, but his eyeswere scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. Ichewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite? \"He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down indisapproval. \"Mountain lion. \"\"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be carefulnot to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focuson areas with an overpopulation of predators — ranging as far away as weneed. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, butwhere's the fun in that? \" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season — they're just coming outof hibernation, so they're more irritable. \" He smiled at some rememberedjoke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking,please. \"\"I'm trying to picture it — but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt abear without weapons? \"\f\"Oh, we have weapons. \" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief,threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you'veever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualizeEmmett hunting. \"I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peekedacross the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking myway. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso weresomehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too? \" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps ourpreferences are indicative. \"I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled withopposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something Imight get to see? \"\"Absolutely not! \" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyeswere suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and — though I'd neveradmit it to him — frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well,folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me? \" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voicecutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be morebeneficial for you. \"\"Then why? \" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. \"We're going to be late. \"I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria wasnearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such amuddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbingmy bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget. Chapter 11 Complications\n    Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticedthat he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the deskwould allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almosttouching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then — what superb timing the man had —pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdatedTV and VCR. A movie day — the lift in the class atmosphere was almosttangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wallto turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edwardwas sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected\felectricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to bemore aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over andtouch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearlyoverwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my handsballing into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes,of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realizedhis posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, rightdown to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyessomehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before Icould start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I shouldfeel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie — I didn'teven know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, butthe electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in hisbody never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glancein his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpoweringcraving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safelyagainst my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on atthe end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing mystiff fingers. Edward chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and hiseyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we? \" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balancemight have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turnedto say goodbye. His face startled me — his expression was torn, almostpained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared asstrong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and thenswiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skinwas as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin wasalarmingly warm — like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of ityet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the lockerroom, changing in a trancelike state, only vaguely aware that there wereother people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I washanded a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. Icould see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. CoachClapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came tostand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team? \"\"Thanks, Mike — you don't have to do this, you know. \" I grimacedapologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way. \" He grinned. Sometimes it was soeasy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head withmy racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest ofthe hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behindmy back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he wonthree games out of four singlehandedly. He gave me an unearned high five\fwhen the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what? \"\"You and Cullen, huh? \" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feelingof affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursingJessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like… like you're something to eat,\" he continued,ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small gigglemanaged to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved andfled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies batteringrecklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike alreadya distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if Ishould meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a waveof real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know thatthey knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walkstraight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worrieswere unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the sideof the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to hisside, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello. \" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym? \"My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really? \" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly,looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike'sback as he walked away. \"What? \" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves. \"\"You weren't listening again? \" I was horror-struck. All traces of mysudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head? \" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable! \" I turned, stomping away in the general directionof the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym — it mademe curious. \" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him.

Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room athome, he paused instead of responding with another question. \"Are you finished? \" I asked in relief. \"Not even close — but your father will be home soon. \"\"Charlie! \" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out atthe rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it? \" Iwondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time— Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon,obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mindwere somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out thewindshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspokenquestion in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way…the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is sopredictable, don't you think? \" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars. \" Ifrowned. \"Not that you see them here much. \"He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell himthat you'll be with me Saturday…\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks. \" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff fromsitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then? \"\"Certainly not! \" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn'tdone, didn't I? \"\"What more is there? \"\"You'll find out tomorrow. \" He reached across to open my door for me, andhis sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it? \" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyesdisturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he saidglumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almostcringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a darkcar pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour atthe other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain waslouder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but itwas too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the newcar's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked onsomething or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix offrustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wetpavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side ofthe little black car. \"Jacob? \" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie'scruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants ofthe car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through thedarkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man witha memorable face — a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against hisshoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an oldleather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes thatseemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad facethey were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately,though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed toforget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He wasstaring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. Hiseyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smilefaded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groanedinternally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he reallybelieve the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could. Chapter 12 Balancing\n    \"Billy! \" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under theporch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he saiddisapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the doorand flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow. \" I recognized Billy's resonant voiceeasily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger,a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lightsbefore I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiouslyas Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off therain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time. \" Hisdark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game. \"Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan — our TV broke last week. \"Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to seeBella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I foughtback a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry? \" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager toescape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie? \" I called over my shoulder as I fled around thecorner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front roomand the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing upa tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things? \" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good. \" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How aboutyou? Did you finish your car? \"\"No. \" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one. \" He pointedwith his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any… what was it you were looking for? \"\"Master cylinder. \" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck? \" headded suddenly. \"No. \"\f\"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it. \"I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check thebottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend. \"\"Nice ride. \" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver,though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here. \"I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere. \"\"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over thesink. \"\"Sure. \"He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it? \" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen. \"To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a littleembarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad wasacting so strange. \"\"That's right. \" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like theCullens. \"\"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie? \" I couldn't help asking,the words coming out in a low rush. Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression inhis dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewedhim out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since — tonightis sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again. \"\"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie,pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was reallylistening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy wasabout to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but Iwas afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon? \" Jacob asked ashe pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night. \" His eyesshifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" headded seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in theliving room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day? \"\"Good. \" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching fordetails I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games. \"\"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton. \"\"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted. \"Who is it? \" he asked with token interest. \"Um… Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah — you said you were friends with the Newton kid. \" He perked up. \"Nice family. \" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to thedance this weekend? \"\"Dad! \" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, youknow I can't dance. \"\"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guessit's good you'll be gone Saturday… I've made plans to go fishing with theguys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if youwanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stayhome. I know I leave you here alone too much. \"\"Dad, you're doing a great job. \" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone — I'm too much like you. \" I winked at him,and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to thepearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billyand Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely. I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hairback into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday. \"I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bagready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door assoon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. Hewas waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, thesooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping mybreath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any moreglorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep? \" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea howappealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night? \"\"Pleasant. \" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an insidejoke. \"Can I ask what you did? \" I asked. \"No. \" He grinned. \"Today is still mine. \"He wanted to know about people today: more about Renée, her hobbies, whatwe'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd\fknown, my few school friends — embarrassing me when he asked about boysI'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so thatparticular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised asJessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted? \" he asked in a serious tone thatmade me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix. \"His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blurthat was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause totake a bite of my bagel."

He wants me to be safe, I told myself againand again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, thatdesire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice — tocut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, itreally seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it wouldhurt very much… if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. Iknew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never donebefore. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine — the kind thatknocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone thattype of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enoughwithout me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till itwas impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. Witheverything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper;I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDsuntil I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on veryquietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individualparts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the coldpills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness. I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to mygratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back intothe same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush,\fsmoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater tillit hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to seethat Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled thesky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I wasdone. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had justfinished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quietknock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, butI yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitationdissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. Ibreathed a sigh of relief — yesterday's fears seemed very foolish withhim here. He wasn't smiling at first — his face was somber. But then his expressionlightened as he looked me over, and he laughed. \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong? \" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anythingimportant, like shoes, or pants. \"We match. \" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweateron, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughedwith him, hiding a secret twinge of regret — why did he have to look likea runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited bythe passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat,and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to? \" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on — I'm nervous already. \"I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to? \" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-oh-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feelinghis gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usualthrough the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall? \"\"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather — have somerespect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thickunderbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. Iobeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends. \"I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving offthe road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end? \" I wondered. \"A trail. \"\"We're hiking? \" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem? \" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No. \" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truckwas slow…\"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry. \"Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack inpanic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twistmy ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking? \" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going. \"\"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice. \" We both glanced outthe windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today. \"\"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to? \" he asked. \"Nope. \"\"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together? \" He seemed cheeredby the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me — which is true. \"\"No one knows you're with me? \" Angrily, now. \"That depends… I assume you told Alice? \"\"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal? \" he demandedwhen I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you… us being together publicly,\" Ireminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me— if you don't comehome? \" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that Icouldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves ofinfuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothingto say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a smallwooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraidbecause he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse notto look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks sincethe day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off mysweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light,sleeveless shirt — especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed hissweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest besidemy truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes stillannoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail? \" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to\fcatch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were takingit. \"\"No trail? \" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost. \" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and Istifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore itunbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat floweduninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfectmusculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He wastoo perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no waythis godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home? \" he said quietly, a different pain than minesaturating his voice. \"No. \" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to wasteone second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong? \" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered dully. \"You'll have to be verypatient. \"\"I can be patient — if I make a great effort. \" He smiled, holding myglance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized myface. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise wasunconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thoughtit was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the oneperson whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown,you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me,struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he heldthe damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path tookus over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by theelbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touchon my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, whenthat happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he couldsomehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, butI slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask arandom question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days ofinterrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, mychildhood pets — and I had to admit that after killing three fish in arow, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louderthan I was used to — bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the emptywoods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign ofimpatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth ofancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our wayout again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, neverseeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopytransformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day\fhad turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'dentered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement — which quickly turnedto impatience. \"Are we there yet? \" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly. \" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightnessahead? \"I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I? \"He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes. \"\"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew morepronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see alightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. Ipicked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me leadnow, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the lastfringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow wassmall, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers — violet, yellow, andsoft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of astream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze ofbuttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass,swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to sharethis with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spunaround, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, stillunder the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watchingme with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of themeadow had driven from my mind — the enigma of Edward and the sun, whichhe'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyeswere wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with myhand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, andI hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into thebright glow of the midday sun. Chapter 13 Confessions\n   Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, thoughI'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faintflush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousandsof tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface."

                "text": "He lay perfectly still inthe grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, hisscintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut,though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in someunknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they weretrembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; itwas too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for mytaste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm myface. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling totake my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffledthe grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like amirage, too beautiful to be real… hesitantly, I reached out one fingerand stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within myreach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool asstone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turnedup the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you? \" he asked playfully, but I could hear the realcuriosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual. \"He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours ofhis forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knewit wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind? \" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how thatfeels. \" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followedthe faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With myother hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, heflipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcertingmovements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a briefsecond. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes closeagain. \"It's too easy to be myself with you. \"I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sunglitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see thehidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyeswatching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing. \"\"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time. \"\"It's a hard life. \" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"Butyou didn't tell me. \"\"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking…\" I hesitated. \"And? \"\"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishingthat I wasn't afraid. \"\"I don't want you to be afraid. \" His voice was just a soft murmur. Iheard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid,that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainlysomething to think about. \"So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up onhis right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was onlya few inches from mine. I might have — should have — flinched away fromhis unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move. His golden eyesmesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then? \" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his coolbreath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. Itwas unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer,\finhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyesto focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the smallmeadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyesdark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm… sorry… Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitiveears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. Hestopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground,crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine. He took two deep breaths,and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry. \" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant ifI said I was only human? \"I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsedthrough my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He couldsmell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites youin — my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that! \"Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight,only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadowin half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlesslyripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balancedit in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed,shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at theblow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'dnever seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human… or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, Isat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the secondspassed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancientsadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionallyseductive. \"I promise…\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you. \" Heseemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, withexaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurriedmovements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caughtme off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now. \"He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly. \" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right? \" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully,to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft,repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned totracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiledtimidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely? \" he asked in the gentlecadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember. \"He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about whyyou were afraid, besides the obvious reason. \"\"Oh, right. \"\"Well? \"I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth,iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptlygrasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As manyyears of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. Itook courage from that thought. \"I was afraid… because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay withyou. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than Ishould. \" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for meto say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest. \"I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But Idon't know if I can. \"\"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially aselfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should. \"\"I'm glad. \"\"Don't be! \" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice washarsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any humanvoice. It was hard to keep up — his sudden mood changes left me always astep behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I ammore dangerous to you than I am to anyone else. \" He stopped, and I lookedto see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean — by that last partanyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain? \" he mused. \"And without frightening you again… hmmmm. \"Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; Iheld it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth. \" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors? \" he began. \"Some peoplelove chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry? \"I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy — I couldn't think of another way toexplain. \"I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If youlocked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy,the rarest, finest cognac — and filled the room with its warm aroma — howdo you think he would fare then? \"We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes — trying to read eachother's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy toturn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroinaddict instead. \"\"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin? \" I teased, trying tolighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactlymy brand of heroin. \"\"Does that happen often? \" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it. \" He still stared into the distance. \"ToJasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to joinour family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had timeto grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor. \" He glancedswiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me,or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try toat least. Just explain however you can. \"He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" — hehesitated, looking for the right word — \"appealing as you are to me. Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so tospeak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, oncestronger than the other. \"\"And for you? \"\"Never. \"The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do? \" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenchedinto a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going toanswer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we? \"\"What are you asking? My permission? \" My voice was sharper than I'dintended. I tried to make my tone kinder — I could guess what his honestymust cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then? \" How calmly I coulddiscuss my own death! \"No, no! \" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope!"

It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as… practiced, as careful, as he isnow. \"He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met… oh, in a dark alley or something…\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class fullof children and —\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walkedpast me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, rightthen and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well,too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself. \" He paused,scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought Iwas possessed. \"\"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly…\"\"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight frommy own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin… Ithought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, Ithought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, toget you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what Icould do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak thewords that would make you follow…\"He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb hisbitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnoticand deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt. \"He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt toavoid you, you were there — in that close, warm little room, the scentwas maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one otherfrail human there — so easily dealt with. \"I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes,only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at howclose I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you,not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn'tsmell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I leftthe others near home — I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was,they only knew something was very wrong — and then I went straight toCarlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving. \"I stared in surprise. \"I traded cars with him — he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want tostop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me gowithout a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn'tnecessary…\"By the next morning I was in Alaska. \" He sounded ashamed, as ifadmitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some oldacquaintances… but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and\fthe rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains itwas hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it wasweak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of thismagnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, aninsignificant little girl\" — he grinned suddenly — \"to chase me from theplace I wanted to be? So I came back…\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing youagain. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any otherhuman. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read yourthoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having togo to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica'smind… her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoopto that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. Itwas all extremely irritating. \" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so Itried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eageractually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were toointeresting, I found myself caught up in your expressions… and every nowand then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and thescent would stun me again…\"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment— because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there infront of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing usfor what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time,all I could think was, 'Not her. '\"He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, moreeager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead,I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassionfor his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital? \"His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I hadput us in danger after all, put myself in your power — you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you. \" We both flinched as that wordslipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"Ifought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now wasthe time… the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, andAlice. \" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esmetold me to do whatever I had to in order to stay. \" He shook his headindulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to,shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But Iknew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best tostay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin,your breath, your hair… it hit me as hard as the very first day. \"He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposedus all at that first moment, than if now, here — with no witnesses andnothing to stop me — I were to hurt you. \"I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why? \"\"Isabella. \" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffledmy hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casualtouch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don'tknow how it's tortured me. \" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thoughtof you, still, white, cold… to never see you blush scarlet again, tonever see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through mypretenses… it would be unendurable. \" He lifted his glorious, agonized\feyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The mostimportant thing to me ever. \"My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversationhad taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we weresuddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down tostudy our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me. \"Youalready know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here… which,roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you. \" Ifrowned. \"I'm an idiot. \"\"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed,too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such amoment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…\" he murmured. I looked away,hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion. \" He stared into the shadowy forest for along moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why… ? \" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth. \"Yes? \"\"Tell me why you ran from me before. \"His smile faded. \"You know why. \"\"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard,you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, forexample\" — I stroked the back of his hand — \"seems to be all right. \"He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault. \"\"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you. \"\"Well…\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by ouralienness… I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of yourthroat. \" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tenseatmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure. \"It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise thananything else. \"He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. Isat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning — a warningtelling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. Therewere, however, other feelings…\"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine. \"My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this mustmake everything so much more difficult — the thudding of my pulse in myveins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed hisother hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek,then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Thenabruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow atthe base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and windplay in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. Ishivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause asthey softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. Hecame to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours. Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speakagain as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and mylife could end — so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn'tmake myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he wastouching me. And then, too soon, he released me. His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you? \"\"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you? \"\"No, it wasn't bad… for me. \"He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean. \"I smiled. \"Here. \" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel howwarm it is? \"And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for Iwas touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since thefirst day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became asimmobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpectedmove. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purpleshadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfectnose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under myhand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to leanin, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, notwanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear,but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send mypulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the… complexity… theconfusion… I feel. That you could understand. \"He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face."

If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing comparedto how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like abullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feettouched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated anyeffort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us byinches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whippedagainst my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking myhead out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time inmy life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow,and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it? \" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but mymuscles wouldn't respond.

He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled mearound to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He heldme for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel? \" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think. \"\"Put your head between your knees. \"I tried that, and it helped a little.

Perhaps he would hesitate toprolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes betterthan the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make surehe was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wildgasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips partedas I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. Hishands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I openedmy eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement. \"His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn'tlapse from his perfect articulation.

He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me — myface, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together.

He gazed intothe sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the roadcompletely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. Helooked into the sun — the light of the setting orb glittered off his skinin ruby-tinged sparkles — and spoke. \"I was born in Chicago in 1901. \" He paused and glanced at me from thecorner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for therest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in ahospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanishinfluenza. \"He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my ownears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well — it was a very long time ago, and humanmemories fade. \" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before hewent on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me.

I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanishinfluenza. \"He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my ownears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well — it was a very long time ago, and humanmemories fade. \" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before hewent on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not aneasy thing, not something you could forget. \"\"Your parents? \"\"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why hechose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize Iwas gone. \"\"How did he… save you?"

Igripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, ofcourse; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something Ineeded to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me? \"\"That depends! \" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out ofme. He waited. \"On? \" he urged. \"What you heard! \" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his. \"Don't be upset! \" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of myeyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away. \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when itrains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot,but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.

I sighed in defeat. \"A lot? \"\"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly? \"\"Oh no! \" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream atall, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it. \"Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw theheadlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us.

I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella? \" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here. \" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. Igrabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walkedin. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward. \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed. \" He stepped on the heels of hisboots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burnedmy tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating,and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticedthe milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in thechair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day? \" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escapeto my room. \"Good. The fish were biting… how about you? Did you get everything donethat you wanted to? \"\"Not really — it was too nice out to stay indoors. \" I took another bigbite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought tomyself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged theremains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry? \"\"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early. \"\"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be hisnight to pay attention? \"Do I? \" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishesclean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight? \" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep. \"\"None of the boys in town your type, eh? \" He was suspicious, but tryingto play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet. \" I was careful not toover-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton… you said he was friendly. \"\"He's Just a friend, Dad. \"\"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to collegeto start looking. \" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out ofthe house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me."

Wait till you get to collegeto start looking. \" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out ofthe house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me."

                "text": "\"My room,\" he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the house must be glass. His view looked down onthe winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest to the OlympicMountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked than a music store. In the corner was asophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to touchbecause I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide andinviting black leather sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden\fcarpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a slightly darkershade. \"Good acoustics? \" I guessed. He chuckled and nodded. He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but thesoft jazz number sounded like the band was in the room with us. I went tolook at his mind-boggling music collection. \"How do you have these organized? \" I asked, unable to find any rhyme orreason to the titles. He wasn't paying attention. \"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,\" hesaid absently. I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. \"What? \"\"I was prepared to feel… relieved. Having you know about everything, notneeding to keep secrets from you. But I didn't expect to feel more thanthat. I like it. It makes me… happy. \" He shrugged, smiling slightly. \"I'm glad,\" I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regrettelling me these things. It was good to know that wasn't the case. But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and hisforehead creased. \"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you? \" Iguessed. A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you thinkyou are. I don't find you scary at all, actually,\" I lied casually. He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed awide, wicked smile. \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" he chuckled. He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled backover his perfect teeth. His body shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensedlike a lion about to pounce. I backed away from him, glaring. \"You wouldn't. \"I didn't see him leap at me — it was much too fast. I only found myselfsuddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it intothe wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protectionaround me — I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried toright myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest,holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, buthe seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes brightonly with humor. \"You were saying? \" he growled playfully. \"That you are a very, very terrifying monster,\" I said, my sarcasm marreda bit by my breathless voice. \"Much better,\" he approved. \"Um. \" I struggled. \"Can I get up now? \"He just laughed. \"Can we come in? \" a soft voice sounded from the hall. I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I wassomewhat more conventionally seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice,then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks burned, but Edwardseemed at ease. \"Go ahead. \" Edward was still chuckling quietly. Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked — almostdanced, her movements were so graceful — to the center of the room, whereshe folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, however, paused atthe door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face,and I wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusualsensitivity. \"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see ifyou would share,\" Alice announced. I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning —whether at her comment or my response, I couldn't tell. \"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,\" he replied, his armsholding me recklessly close. \"Actually,\" Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into theroom, \"Alice says there's going to be a real storm tonight, and Emmettwants to play ball. Are you game? \"The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gatheredthat Alice was a bit more reliable than the weatherman, though. Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. \"Of course you should bring Bella,\" Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasperthrow a quick glance at her. \"Do you want to go? \" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. \"Sure. \" I couldn't disappoint such a face. \"Um, where are we going? \"\"We have to wait for thunder to play ball — you'll see why,\" he promised. \"Will I need an umbrella? \"They all three laughed aloud. \"Will she? \" Jasper asked Alice. \"No. \" She was positive. \"The storm will hit over town. It should be dryenough in the clearing. \"\"Good, then. \" The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. Ifound myself eager, rather than scared stiff. \"Let's go see if Carlisle will come. \" Alice bounded up and to the door ina fashion that would break any ballerina's heart. \"Like you don't know,\" Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to inconspicuously close the door behind them. \"What will we be playing? \" I demanded. \"You will be watching,\" Edward clarified. \"We will be playing baseball. \"I rolled my eyes. \"Vampires like baseball? \"\"It's the American pastime,\" he said with mock solemnity. Chapter 17 The Game \n    It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Upuntil that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while Ispent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie'sdriveway — and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low,harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Blackstood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stoneas Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, hisexpression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line. \"\"He came to warn Charlie? \" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowedeyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made meanxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. Thechild has no idea. \"I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much youngerthan I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assuredme with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back arounddusk. \"\"Do you want my truck? \" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I wouldexplain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves. \"\"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid ofthem\" — he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction — \"you still haveto prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend. \" He grinned widely,showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot. \"He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" hepromised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in toswiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurchedfrantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was nolonger impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle\ftoward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob. \" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day — I hope you haven't been waiting long. \"\"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up. \" He indicated a brown paper sack restingin his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't youcome in for a minute and dry off? \"I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked thedoor, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowedmyself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, hiseyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me thepackage. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry — Charlie'sfavorite. The fridge keeps it drier. \" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out ofnew ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight. \"\"Fishing again? \" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at theusual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him. \"\"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new…but I have no idea where. \"He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that newpicture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too. \"\"Where is it? \" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but hewas staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it. \"Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quietstarted to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I couldhear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spunaround to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time. \" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said,and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends. \"\"Yes. \"He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you'vebeen spending time with one of the Cullens. \"\"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't thinkthat is such a good idea. \"\"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business. \"He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this,but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation. \"\"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. Thissurprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it? Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they? \" I couldsee that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both boundand protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem… well informedabout the Cullens. More informed than I expected. \"I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are. \"He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe. \" he allowed, buthis eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed? \"He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood myevasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's. \"\"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it'sCharlie's business, right? \"I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled notto say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it whilethe rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too. \"I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy. \"\"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing."

I ran up the stairs to my room, throwing the door shutand locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to retrievemy duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring tograb the knotted old sock that contained my secret cash hoard. Charlie was pounding on my door. \"Bella, are you okay? What's going on? \" His voice was frightened. \"I'm going borne,\" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. \"Did he hurt you? \" His tone edged toward anger. \"No! \" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edwardwas already there, silently yanking out armfuls of random clothes, whichhe proceeded to throw to me. \"Did he break up with you? \" Charlie was perplexed. \"No! \" I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into thebag. Edward threw another drawer's contents at me. The bag was prettymuch full now. \"What happened, Bella? \" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. \"I broke up with him! \" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed mine away and zipped it smoothly. He putthe strap carefully over my arm. \"I'll be in the truck — go! \" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door. He vanished out the window. I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with myheavy bag as I ran down the stairs. \"What happened? \" he yelled. He was right behind me. \"I thought you likedhim. \"He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, hisgrip was firm. He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he hadno intention of letting me leave. I could think of only one way toescape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for evenconsidering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about todo. \"I do like him — that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't putdown any more roots here! I don't want to end up trapped in this stupid,boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb mistake shedid. I hate it — I can't stay here another minute! \"His hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him. I turned awayfrom his shocked, wounded face and headed for the door. \"Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime,\" he whispered behind me. I didn't turn around. \"I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired. \"\"Just wait another week,\" he pled, still shell-shocked. \"Renée will beback by then. \"This completely derailed me. \"What? \"Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. \"She called while you were out. Things aren't going so well in Florida,and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going backto Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have aspot for another shortstop. \"I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Everypassing second put Charlie in more danger. \"I have a key,\" I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one handextended toward me, his face dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguingwith him. I was going to have to hurt him further. \"Just let me go, Charlie. \" I repeated my mother's last words as she'dwalked out this same door so many years ago. I said them as angrily as Icould manage, and I threw the door open. \"It didn't work out, okay? Ireally, really hate Forks! \"My cruel words did their job — Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep,stunned, while I ran into the night. I was hideously frightened of theempty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow behindme. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key waswaiting in the ignition. \"I'll call you tomorrow! \" I yelled, wishing more than anything that I\fcould explain everything to him right then, knowing I would never be ableto. I gunned the engine and peeled out. Edward reached for my hand. \"Pull over,\" he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. \"I can drive,\" I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mineoff the gas pedal. He pulled me across his lap, wrenching my hands freeof the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver's seat. The truck didn'tswerve an inch. \"You wouldn't be able to find the house,\" he explained. Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes widewith horror. \"It's just Alice,\" he reassured me. He took my hand again. My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. \"Thetracker? \"\"He heard the end of your performance,\" Edward said grimly. \"Charlie? \" I asked in dread. \"The tracker followed us. He's running behind us now. \"My body went cold. \"Can we outrun him? \"\"No. \" But he sped up as he spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest. My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore. I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and adark shadow sprung up outside the window. My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward'shand clamped down on my mouth. \"It's Emmett! \"He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. \"It's okay, Bella,\" he promised. \"You're going to be safe. \"We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. \"I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" he saidconversationally, and I knew he was trying to distract me. \"It seemedlike you were adjusting fairly well — especially recently. Maybe I wasjust flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you. \"\"I wasn't being nice,\" I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion,looking down at my knees. \"That was the same thing my mom said when sheleft him. You could say I was hitting below the belt. \"\"Don't worry. He'll forgive you. \" He smiled a little, though it didn'ttouch his eyes. I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. \"Bella, it's going to be all right. \"\"But it won't be all right when I'm not with you,\" I whispered. \"We'll be together again in a few days,\" he said, tightening his armaround me. \"Don't forget that this was your idea. \"\f\"It was the best idea — of course it was mine. \"His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. \"Why did this happen? \" I asked, my voice catching. \"Why me? \"He stared blackly at the road ahead. \"It's my fault — I was a fool toexpose you like that. \" The rage in his voice was directed internally. \"That's not what I meant,\" I insisted. \"I was there, big deal. It didn'tbother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill met There'repeople all over the place, why me? \"He hesitated, thinking before he answered. \"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" he began in a low voice. \"I'mnot sure if there's anything I could have done to avoid this, once he sawyou. It is partially your fault. \" His voice was wry. \"If you didn't smellso appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defendedyou… well, that made it a lot worse. He's not used to being thwarted, nomatter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter andnothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge isall he asks of life. Suddenly we've presented him with a beautifulchallenge — a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting theone vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he is now. It'shis favorite game, and we've just made it his most exciting game ever. \"His tone was full of disgust. He paused a moment. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" he saidwith hopeless frustration. \"I thought… I didn't smell the same to the others… as I do to you,\" Isaid hesitantly. \"You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation toevery one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker — or any of them —the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there. \"I shuddered. \"I don't think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" he muttered. \"Carlisle won't like it. \"I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the riverin the dark. I knew we were getting close. I had to ask him now. \"How can you kill a vampire? \"He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn thepieces. \"\"And the other two will fight with him? \"\"The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a verystrong bond — he's only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed byJames in the meadow…\"\"But James and the woman — they'll try to kill you? \" I asked, my voiceraw. \"Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern iskeeping yourself safe and — please, please — trying not to be reckless. \"\"Is he still following? \"\"Yes. He won't attack the house, though. Not tonight. \"He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but theydid little to alleviate the blackness of the encroaching forest. Emmetthad my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of theseat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me throughthe door. We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All ofthem were there; they were already on their feet at the sound of ourapproach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls rumbledeep in Emmett's throat as he set me down next to Edward. \"He's tracking us,\" Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. Laurent's face was unhappy. \"I was afraid of that. \"Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his ear; her lips quiveredwith the speed of her silent speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's side. Herbeautiful eyes were intense and — when they flickered unwillingly to myface — furious. \"What will he do? \" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. \"I'm sorry,\" he answered. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defendedher, that it would set him off. \"\"Can you stop him? \"Laurent shook his head. \"Nothing stops James when he gets started. \"\"We'll stop him,\" Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. \"You can't bring him down. I've never seen anything like him in my threehundred years. He's absolutely lethal. That's why I joined his coven. \"His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearingwas merely that, a show. Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back toCarlisle. \"Are you sure it's worth it? \"Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. \"I'm afraid you're going to have tomake a choice. \"Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in everyface, and finally swept the bright room. \"I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in themiddle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won't go up againstJames. I think I will head north — to that clan in Denali. \" He hesitated. \"Don't underestimate James. He's got a brilliant mind and unparalleledsenses. He's every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem tobe, and he won't come at you head on… I'm sorry for what's been unleashedhere. Truly sorry. \" He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker anotherpuzzled look at me. \"Go in peace,\" was Carlisle's formal answer. Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried outthe door. The silence lasted less than a second. \"How close? \" Carlisle looked to Edward. Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on thewall, and with a groan, huge metal shutters began sealing up the glasswall. I gaped. \"About three miles out past the river; he's circling around to meet upwith the female. \"\"What's the plan?"

Edward turned to Rosalie. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" Edward commanded. She stared backat him with livid disbelief. \"Why should I? \" she hissed. \"What is she to me? Except a menace — adanger you've chosen to inflict on all of us. \"I flinched back from the venom in her voice. \"Rose…\" Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook itoff. But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried abouthis reaction. He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn't spoken, asif she didn't exist. \"Esme? \" he asked calmly. \"Of course,\" Esme murmured. Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into herarms, and dashing up the stairs before I could gasp in shock. \"What are we doing? \" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a darkroom somewhere off the second-story hall. \"Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might helpget you out. \" I could hear her clothes falling to the floor. \"I don't think I'll fit…\" I hesitated, but her hands were abruptlypulling my shirt over my head. I quickly stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my armsthrough the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. Shedeftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. Somehow she wasalready in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alicestood, a small leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of myelbows and half-carried me as they flew down the stairs. It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-lookingbackpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing — it was a tiny silver cellphone. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" he told me as hepassed. I nodded, glancing warily at Rosalie. She was glowering atCarlisle with a resentful expression. \"Alice, Jasper — take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in thesouth. \"They nodded as well. \"We're taking the Jeep. \"\fI was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. Irealized suddenly, with a stab of fear, that they made up the huntingparty. \"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait? \"Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. Finally her eyes opened. \"He'll track you. The woman will follow thetruck. We should be able to leave after that. \" Her voice was certain. \"Let's go. \" Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip,crushing me to him. He seemed unaware of his watching family as he pulledmy face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest second,his lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set medown, still holding my face, his glorious eyes burning into mine. His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. And they were gone. We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streakednoiselessly down my face. The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. \"Now,\" she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without anotherglance in my direction, but Esme touched my cheek as she passed. \"Be safe. \" Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start thunderously, and then fade away. Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her ear before itbuzzed. \"Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car. \" Shevanished into the shadows the way Edward had gone. Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of theentryway from me… being careful. \"You're wrong, you know,\" he said quietly. \"What? \" I gasped. \"I can feel what you're feeling now — and you are worth it. \"\"I'm not,\" I mumbled. \"If anything happens to them, it will be fornothing. \"\"You're wrong,\" he repeated, smiling kindly at me. I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and cametoward me with her arms held out. \"May I? \" she asked. \"You're the first one to ask permission. \" I smiled wryly. She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding meprotectively, and then we flew out the door, leaving the lights brightbehind us. Chapter 20 Impatience\n    When I woke up I was confused. My thoughts were hazy, still twisted up indreams and nightmares; it took me longer than it should have to realizewhere I was. This room was too bland to belong anywhere but in a hotel. The bedsidelamps, bolted to the tables, were a dead giveaway, as were the longdrapes made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the genericwatercolor prints on the walls. I tried to remember how I got here, but nothing came at first. I did remember the sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker thanthat on a limousine. The engine was almost silent, though we'd racedacross the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed. And I remembered Alice sitting with me on the dark leather backseat. Somehow, during the long night, my head had ended up against her graniteneck. My closeness didn't seem to bother her at all, and her cool, hardskin was oddly comforting to me. The front of her thin cotton shirt wascold, damp with the tears that streamed from my eyes until, red and sore,they ran dry. Sleep had evaded me; my aching eyes strained open even though the nightfinally ended and dawn broke over a low peak somewhere in California. Thegray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung my eyes. But Icouldn't close them; when I did, the images that flashed all too vividly,like still slides behind my lids, were unbearable. Charlie's brokenexpression — Edward's brutal snarl, teeth bared — Rosalie's resentfulglare — the keen-eyed scrutiny of the tracker — the dead look in Edward'seyes after he kissed me the last time… I couldn't stand to see them. So Ifought against my weariness and the sun rose higher. I was still awake when we came through a shallow mountain pass and thesun, behind us now, reflected off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of theSun. I didn't have enough emotion left to be surprised that we'd made athree-day journey in one. I stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laidout in front of me. Phoenix — the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, thehaphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the green swaths of golfcourses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in athin smog and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren't really bigenough to be called mountains. The shadows of the palm trees slanted across the freeway — defined,sharper than I remembered, paler than they should be. Nothing could hidein these shadows. The bright, open freeway seemed benign enough. But Ifelt no relief, no sense of homecoming. \"Which way to the airport, Bella? \" Jasper had asked, and I flinched,though his voice was quite soft and un-alarming. It was the first sound,besides the purr of the car, to break the long night's silence. \"Stay on the I-ten,\" I'd answered automatically. \"We'll pass right by it. \"My brain had worked slowly through the fog of sleep deprivation. \"Are we flying somewhere? \" I'd asked Alice. \"No, but it's better to be close, just in case. \"I remembered beginning the loop around Sky Harbor International… but notending it. I suppose that must have been when I'd fallen asleep. Though, now that I'd chased the memories down, I did have a vagueimpression of leaving the car — the sun was just falling behind thehorizon — my arm draped over Alice's shoulder and her arm firm around mywaist, dragging me along as I stumbled through the warm, dry shadows. I had no memory of this room. I looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. The red numbers claimedit was three o'clock, but they gave no indication if it was night or day. No edge of light escaped the thick curtains, but the room was bright withthe light from the lamps. I rose stiffly and staggered to the window, pulling back the drapes. It was dark outside. Three in the morning, then. My room looked out on adeserted section of the freeway and the new long-term parking garage forthe airport. It was slightly comforting to be able to pinpoint time andplace. I looked down at myself. I was still wearing Esme's clothes, and theydidn't fit very well at all. I looked around the room, glad when Idiscovered my duffel bag on top of the low dresser. I was on my way to find new clothes when a light tap on the door made mejump. \"Can I come in? \" Alice asked. I took a deep breath. \"Sure. \"She walked in, and looked me over cautiously. \"You look like you couldsleep longer,\" she said. I just shook my head. She drifted silently to the curtains and closed them securely beforeturning back to me. \"We'll need to stay inside,\" she told me. \"Okay. \" My voice was hoarse; it cracked. \"Thirsty? \" she asked. I shrugged. \"I'm okay. How about you? \"\"Nothing unmanageable. \" She smiled. \"I ordered some food for you, it's inthe front room. Edward reminded me that you have to eat a lot morefrequently than we do. \"I was instantly more alert. \"He called? \"\"No,\" she said, and watched as my face fell. \"It was before we left. \"She took my hand carefully and led me through the door into the livingroom of the hotel suite. I could hear a low buzz of voices coming fromthe TV. Jasper sat motionlessly at the desk in the corner, his eyeswatching the news with no glimmer of interest. I sat on the floor next to the coffee table, where a tray of food waited,and began picking at it without noticing what I was eating. Alice perched on the arm of the sofa and stared blankly at the TV likeJasper. I ate slowly, watching her, turning now and then to glance quickly atJasper. It began to dawn on me that they were too still. They neverlooked away from the screen, though commercials were playing now. Ipushed the tray away, my stomach abruptly uneasy. Alice looked down at me. \"What's wrong, Alice? \" I asked. \"Nothing's wrong. \" Her eyes were wide, honest… and I didn't trust them. \"What do we do now? \"\"We wait for Carlisle to call. \"\"And should he have called by now? \" I could see that I was near the mark. Alice's eyes flitted from mine to the phone on top of her leather bag andback. \"What does that mean? \" My voice quavered, and I fought to control it. \"That he hasn't called yet? \"\"It just means that they don't have anything to tell us. \"But her voice was too even, and the air was harder to breathe. Jasper was suddenly beside Alice, closer to me than usual. \"Bella,\" he said in a suspiciously soothing voice. \"You have nothing toworry about. You are completely safe here. \"\"I know that. \"\"Then why are you frightened? \" he asked, confused. He might feel thetenor of my emotions, but he couldn't read the reasons behind them. \"You heard what Laurent said. \" My voice was just a whisper, but I wassure they could hear me. \"He said James was lethal. What if somethinggoes wrong, and they get separated? If something happens to any of them,Carlisle, Emmett… Edward…\" I gulped. \"If that wild female hurts Esme…\" Myvoice had grown higher, a note of hysteria beginning to rise in it. \"Howcould I live with myself when it's my fault? None of you should berisking yourselves for me —\"\"Bella, Bella, stop,\" he interrupted me, his words pouring out so quicklythey were hard to understand. \"You're worrying about all the wrongthings, Bella. Trust me on this — none of us are in jeopardy. You areunder too much strain as it is; don't add to it with wholly unnecessaryworries. Listen to me! \" he ordered, for I had looked away. \"Our family isstrong. Our only fear is losing you. \"\"But why should you —\"Alice interrupted this time, touching my cheek with her cold fingers. \"It's been almost a century that Edward's been alone. Now he's found you."

I was a terrible dancer —they always put me in the back for recitals,\" I admitted. \"So there's no way it could be connected with you? \" Alice asked intently. \"No, I don't even think the same person owns it.

I didn't miss the look theyexchanged. \"Here in Phoenix, then? \" His voice was still casual. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Fifty-eighth Street and Cactus. \"We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing. \"Alice, is that phone safe? \"\"Yes,\" she reassured me. \"The number would just trace back to Washington. \"\"Then I can use it to call my mom. \"\"I thought she was in Florida. \"\"She is — but she's coming home soon, and she can't come back to thathouse while…\" My voice trembled. I was thinking about something Edwardhad said, about the red-haired female at Charlie's house, at the school,where my records would be. \"How will you reach her? \"\"They don't have a permanent number except at the house — she's supposedto check her messages regularly. \"\"Jasper? \" Alice asked. He thought about it. \"I don't think there's any way it could hurt — besure you don't say where you are, of course. \"I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rangfour times, and then I heard my mom's breezy voice telling me to leave amessage. \"Mom,\" I said after the beep, \"it's me. Listen, I need you to dosomething. It's important. As soon as you get this message, call me atthis number. \" Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me onthe bottom of her picture. I read it carefully, twice. \"Please don't goanywhere until you talk to me. Don't worry, I'm okay, but I have to talkto you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? Ilove you, Mom. Bye. \" I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might thatno unforeseen change of plans would bring her home before she got mymessage. I settled into the sofa, nibbling on a plate of leftover fruit,\fanticipating a long evening. I thought about calling Charlie, but Iwasn't sure if I should be home by now or not. I concentrated on thenews, watching out for stories about Florida, or about spring training —strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks — anything that might sendthem home early. Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemedto feel the need to do anything at all. For a while, Alice sketched thevague outline of the dark room from her vision, as much as she could seein the light from the TV. But when she was done, she simply sat, lookingat the blank walls with her timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have nourge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run screaming out thedoor, the way I did. I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ringagain. The touch of Alice's cold hands woke me briefly as she carried meto the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the pillow. Chapter 21 Phone Call\n    I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was gettingthe schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed andlistened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. Thatthey were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till myfeet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice andJasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again whileJasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, tooengrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more? \" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it'slight now. \"I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its lowceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date. The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a largewindow against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall ledto the living room. One side of that entrance was stone — a large tanstone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room fromthis perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand,were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curvedaround in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house. \"Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at theprecise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically,Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, andthe physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. Thepanic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzingimpossible to decipher. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are goingto take you somewhere, to hide you for a while. \"\"Edward is coming? \" The words were like a life vest, holding my headabove the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him atthe airport, and you'll leave with him. \"\"But, my mother… he came here for my mother, Alice! \" Despite Jasper, thehysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe. \"\"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't yousee what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone,he'll hurt someone I love… Alice, I can't —\"\"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Doyou think it's only my human family he can hurt me with? \"Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washedover me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggledagainst the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open andstood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could befree to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. Forthree and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out ofthis nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only onepossible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how manyother people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would seeEdward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also beable to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of mybehavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would knowhow grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention wasthat, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at theclock — it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land atnine-forty-five. \" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he washere. \"Where's Jasper? \"\"He went to check out. \"\"You aren't staying here? \"\"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house. \"My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I wasalready walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello? \" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here. \" She held the phone out tome. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello? \"\f\"Bella? Bella? \" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had hearda thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to theedge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. Itwas the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message asunalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly awayfrom Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes onme. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explaineverything, I promise. \"I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom? \"\"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to. \" The voice Iheard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenorvoice, a very pleasant, generic voice — the kind of voice that you heardin the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say,and she'll be fine. \" He paused for a minute while I listened in mutehorror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, anddo try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are. '\"\"No, Mom, stay where you are. \" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult. \" The voice was amused, stilllight and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so yourface doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother tosuffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me. ' Say itnow. \"\"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to thebedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behindme, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"But they can still hear you, I'm sure. \"\"Yes. \"\"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me. '\"\"Mom, trust me. \"\"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait,but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn'tit? Less suspense, less anxiety for you. \"I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to getaway from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"No. \"\"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creativethan that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother'slife depended on it? Answer yes or no. \"Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to theairport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out…\"Yes. \"\"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest\fhint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for yourmother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us bynow to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyonealong with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your motherif that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go toyour mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it,and I'll tell you where to go from there. \" I already knew where I wouldgo, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructionsexactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil? \" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please. \"I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious whenyou go back to them. Tell them that your mother called, and that youtalked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me,'Thank you, Mom. ' Say it now. \"\"Thank you, Mom. \" The tears were coming."

' Say it now. \"\"I love you, Mom. \" My voice was thick. \"I'll see you soon,\" I promised. \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again. \" He hung up. I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror — Icouldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of mymother's panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control. Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall ofpain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirroredroom and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my motheralive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning thegame, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there wasno way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influencehim. But I still had no choice. I had to try. I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It didno good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly,because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them wasabsolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feelmy anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them frombeing suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifleit. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with theairport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Aliceaway…I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had todeal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back. I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one lastglimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going tohurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture washover me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and\fwent to face Alice. The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarmand I didn't wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I'd nevermanage improvisation now. \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convincedher to stay away. \" My voice was lifeless. \"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry. \"I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I wentto it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That wasgood. \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If Iwrite a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at thehouse, I mean. \"\"Sure, Bella. \" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart atthe seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control. I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside tableto write. \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know itmay not work. I am so very, very sorry. Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will bea miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please. And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think. I can't bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For me. I love you. Forgive me. BellaI folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventuallyhe would find it. I only hoped he would understand, and listen to me justthis once. And then I carefully sealed away my heart. Chapter 22 Hide and Seek\n    It had taken much less time than I'd thought — all the terror, thedespair, the shattering of my heart. The minutes were ticking by moreslowly than usual. Jasper still hadn't come back when I returned toAlice. I was afraid to be in the same room with her, afraid that shewould guess… and afraid to hide from her for the same reason. I would have thought I was far beyond the ability to be surprised, mythoughts tortured and unstable, but I was surprised when I saw Alice bentover the desk, gripping the edge with two hands. \"Alice? \"She didn't react when I called her name, but her head was slowly rockingside to side, and I saw her face. Her eyes were blank, dazed… My thoughtsflew to my mother. Was I already too late? I hurried to her side, reaching out automatically to touch her hand. \"Alice! \" Jasper's voice whipped, and then he was right behind her, hishands curling over hers, loosening them from their grip on the table. Across the room, the door swung shut with a low click. \"What is it? \" he demanded. She turned her face away from me, into his chest. \"Bella,\" she said. \"I'm right here,\" I replied. Her head twisted around, her eyes locking on mine, their expression stillstrangely blank. I realized at once that she hadn't been speaking to me,she'd been answering Jasper's question. \"What did you see? \" I said — and there was no question in my flat,uncaring voice. Jasper looked at me sharply. I kept my expression vacant and waited. Hiseyes were confused as they flickered swiftly between Alice's face andmine, feeling the chaos… for I could guess what Alice had seen now. I felt a tranquil atmosphere settle around me. I welcomed it, using it tokeep my emotions disciplined, under control. Alice, too, recovered herself. \"Nothing, really,\" she answered finally, her voice remarkably calm andconvincing. \"Just the same room as before. \"She finally looked at me, her expression smooth and withdrawn. \"Did youwant breakfast? \"\"No, I'll eat at the airport. \" I was very calm, too. I went to thebathroom to shower. Almost as if I were borrowing Jasper's strange extrasense, I could feel Alice's wild — though well-concealed — desperation tohave me out of the room, to be alone with Jasper. So she could tell himthat they were doing something wrong, that they were going to fail…I got ready methodically, concentrating on each little task. I left myhair down, swirling around me, covering my face. The peaceful mood Jaspercreated worked its way through me and helped me think clearly. Helped meplan. I dug through my bag until I found my sock full of money. I emptiedit into my pocket. I was anxious to get to the airport, and glad when we left by seven. Isat alone this time in the back of the dark car. Alice leaned against thedoor, her face toward Jasper but, behind her sunglasses, shooting glancesin my direction every few seconds. \"Alice? \" I asked indifferently. She was wary. \"Yes? \"\"How does it work? The things that you see? \" I stared out the sidewindow, and my voice sounded bored. \"Edward said it wasn't definite… thatthings change? \" It was harder than I would have thought to say his name. That must have been what alerted Jasper, why a fresh wave of serenityfilled the car. \"Yes, things change…\" she murmured — hopefully, I thought. \"Some thingsare more certain than others… like the weather. People are harder. I onlysee the course they're on while they're on it. Once they change theirminds — make a new decision, no matter how small — the whole futureshifts. \"\fI nodded thoughtfully. \"So you couldn't see James in Phoenix until hedecided to come here. \"\"Yes,\" she agreed, wary again. And she hadn't seen me in the mirror room with James until I'd made thedecision to meet him there. I tried not to think about what else shemight have seen. I didn't want my panic to make Jasper more suspicious. They would be watching me twice as carefully now, anyway, after Alice'svision. This was going to be impossible. We got to the airport. Luck was with me, or maybe it was just good odds. Edward's plane was landing in terminal four, the largest terminal, wheremost flights landed — so it wasn't surprising that his was. But it wasthe terminal I needed: the biggest, the most confusing. And there was adoor on level three that might be the only chance. We parked on the fourth floor of the huge garage. I led the way, for oncemore knowledgeable about my surroundings than they were. We took theelevator down to level three, where the passengers unloaded. Alice andJasper spent a long time looking at the departing flights board. I couldhear them discussing the pros and cons of New York, Atlanta, Chicago. Places I'd never seen. And would never see. I waited for my opportunity, impatient, unable to stop my toe fromtapping. We sat in the long rows of chairs by the metal detectors, Jasperand Alice pretending to people-watch but really watching me. Every inch Ishifted in my seat was followed by a quick glance out of the corner oftheir eyes. It was hopeless. Should I run? Would they dare to stop mephysically in this public place? Or would they simply follow? I pulled the unmarked envelope out of my pocket and set it on top ofAlice's black leather bag. She looked at me. \"My letter,\" I said. She nodded, tucking it under the top flap. He wouldfind it soon enough. The minutes passed and Edward's arrival grew closer. It was amazing howevery cell in my body seemed to know he was coming, to long for hiscoming. That made it very hard. I found myself trying to think of excusesto stay, to see him first and then make my escape. But I knew that wasimpossible if I was going to have any chance to get away. Several times Alice offered to go get breakfast with me. Later, I toldher, not yet. I stared at the arrival board, watching as flight after flight arrived ontime. The flight from Seattle crept closer to the top of the board. And then, when I had only thirty minutes to make my escape, the numberschanged. His plane was ten minutes early. I had no more time. \"I think I'll eat now,\" I said quickly. Alice stood. \"I'll come with you. \"\"Do you mind if Jasper comes instead? \" I asked. \"I'm feeling a little…\" Ididn't finish the sentence. My eyes were wild enough to convey what Ididn't say. Jasper stood up. Alice's eyes were confused, but — I saw to my relief—not suspicious. She must be attributing the change in her vision to somemaneuver of the tracker's rather than a betrayal by me. Jasper walked silently beside me, his hand on the small of my back, as ifhe were guiding me. I pretended a lack of interest in the first fewairport cafes, my head scanning for what I really wanted. And there itwas, around the corner, out of Alice's sharp sight: the level-threeladies' room. \"Do you mind? \" I asked Jasper as we passed. \"I'll just be a moment. \"\f\"I'll be right here,\" he said. As soon as the door shut behind me, I was running. I remembered the timeI had gotten lost from this bathroom, because it had two exits. Outside the far door it was only a short sprint to the elevators, and ifJasper stayed where he said he would, I'd never be in his line of sight. I didn't look behind me as I ran. This was my only chance, and even if hesaw me, I had to keep going. People stared, but I ignored them. Aroundthe corner the elevators were waiting, and I dashed forward, throwing myhand between the closing doors of a full elevator headed down. I squeezedin beside the irritated passengers, and checked to make sure that thebutton for level one had been pushed. It was already lit, and the doorsclosed. As soon as the door opened I was off again, to the sound of annoyedmurmurs behind me. I slowed myself as I passed the security guards by theluggage carousels, only to break into a run again as the exit doors cameinto view. I had no way of knowing if Jasper was looking for me yet. I would have only seconds if he was following my scent. I jumped out theautomatic doors, nearly smacking into the glass when they opened tooslowly. Along the crowded curb there wasn't a cab in sight. I had no time. Alice and Jasper were either about to realize I was gone,or they already had. They would find me in a heartbeat. A shuttle to the Hyatt was just closing its doors a few feet behind me. \"Wait! \" I called, running, waving at the driver. \"This is the shuttle to the Hyatt,\" the driver said in confusion as heopened the doors. \"Yes,\" I huffed, \"that's where I'm going. \" I hurried up the steps. He looked askance at my luggage-less state, but then shrugged, not caringenough to ask. Most of the seats were empty. I sat as far from the other travelers aspossible, and watched out the window as first the sidewalk, and then theairport, drifted away."

                "text": "I couldn't help imagining Edward, where he wouldstand at the edge of the road when he found the end of my trail. Icouldn't cry yet, I told myself. I still had a long way to go. My luck held. In front of the Hyatt, a tired-looking couple was gettingtheir last suitcase out of the trunk of a cab. I jumped out of theshuttle and ran to the cab, sliding into the seat behind the driver. Thetired couple and the shuttle driver stared at me. I told the surprised cabbie my mother's address. \"I need to get there assoon as possible. \"\"That's in Scottsdale,\" he complained. I threw four twenties over the seat. \"Will that be enough? \"\"Sure, kid, no problem. \"I sat back against the seat, folding my arms across my lap. The familiarcity began to rush around me, but I didn't look out the windows. Iexerted myself to maintain control. I was determined not to lose myselfat this point, now that my plan was successfully completed. There was nopoint in indulging in more terror, more anxiety. My path was set. I justhad to follow it now. So, instead of panicking, I closed my eyes and spent the twenty minutes'\n　　\fdrive with Edward. I imagined that I had stayed at the airport to meet Edward. I visualizedhow I would stand on my toes, the sooner to see his face. How quickly,how gracefully he would move through the crowds of people separating us. And then I would run to close those last few feet between us — recklessas always — and I would be in his marble arms, finally safe. I wondered where we would have gone. North somewhere, so he could beoutside in the day. Or maybe somewhere very remote, so we could lay inthe sun together again. I imagined him by the shore, his skin sparklinglike the sea. It wouldn't matter how long we had to hide. To be trappedin a hotel room with him would be a kind of heaven. So many questions Istill had for him. I could talk to him forever, never sleeping, neverleaving his side. I could see his face so clearly now… almost hear his voice. And, despiteall the horror and hopelessness, I was fleetingly happy. So involved wasI in my escapist daydreams, I lost all track of the seconds racing by. \"Hey, what was the number? \"The cabbie's question punctured my fantasy, letting all the colors runout of my lovely delusions. Fear, bleak and hard, was waiting to fill theempty space they left behind. \"Fifty-eight twenty-one. \" My voice sounded strangled. The cabbie lookedat me, nervous that I was having an episode or something. \"Here we are, then. \" He was anxious to get me out of his car, probablyhoping I wouldn't ask for my change. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. There was no need to be afraid, I remindedmyself. The house was empty. I had to hurry; my mom was waiting for me,frightened, depending on me. I ran to the door, reaching up automatically to grab the key under theeave. I unlocked the door. It was dark inside, empty, normal. I ran tothe phone, turning on the kitchen light on my way. There, on thewhiteboard, was a ten-digit number written in a small, neat hand. Myfingers stumbled over the keypad, making mistakes. I had to hang up andstart again. I concentrated only on the buttons this time, carefullypressing each one in turn. I was successful. I held the phone to my earwith a shaking hand. It rang only once. \"Hello, Bella,\" that easy voice answered. \"That was very quick. I'mimpressed. \"\"Is my mom all right? \"\"She's perfectly fine. Don't worry, Bella, I have no quarrel with her. Unless you didn't come alone, of course. \" Light, amused. \"I'm alone. \" I'd never been more alone in my entire life. \"Very good. Now, do you know the ballet studio just around the cornerfrom your home? \"\"Yes. I know how to get there. \"\"Well, then, I'll see you very soon. \"I hung up. I ran from the room, through the door, out into the baking heat. There was no time to look back at my house, and I didn't want to see itas it was now — empty, a symbol of fear instead of sanctuary. The lastperson to walk through those familiar rooms was my enemy. From the corner of my eye, I could almost see my mother standing in theshade of the big eucalyptus tree where I'd played as a child. Or kneeling\fby the little plot of dirt around the mailbox, the cemetery of all theflowers she'd tried to grow. The memories were better than any reality Iwould see today. But I raced away from them, toward the corner, leavingeverything behind me. I felt so slow, like I was running through wet sand — I couldn't seem toget enough purchase from the concrete. I tripped several times, oncefalling, catching myself with my hands, scraping them on the sidewalk,and then lurching up to plunge forward again. But at last I made it tothe corner. Just another street now; I ran, sweat pouring down my face,gasping. The sun was hot on my skin, too bright as it bounced off thewhite concrete and blinded me. I felt dangerously exposed. More fiercelythan I would have dreamed I was capable of, I wished for the green,protective forests of Forks… of home. When I rounded the last corner, onto Cactus, I could see the studio,looking just as I remembered it. The parking lot in front was empty, thevertical blinds in all the windows drawn. I couldn't run anymore — Icouldn't breathe; exertion and fear had gotten the best of me. I thoughtof my mother to keep my feet moving, one in front of the other. As I got closer, I could see the sign inside the door. It was handwrittenon hot pink paper; it said the dance studio was closed for spring break. I touched the handle, tugged on it cautiously. It was unlocked. I foughtto catch my breath, and opened the door. The lobby was dark and empty, cool, the air conditioner thrumming. Theplastic molded chairs were stacked along the walls, and the carpetsmelled like shampoo. The west dance floor was dark, I could see throughthe open viewing window. The east dance floor, the bigger room, was lit. But the blinds were closed on the window. Terror seized me so strongly that I was literally trapped by it. Icouldn't make my feet move forward. And then my mother's voice called. \"Bella? Bella? \" That same tone of hysterical panic. I sprinted to thedoor, to the sound of her voice. \"Bella, you scared me! Don't you ever do that to me again! \" Her voicecontinued as I ran into the long, high-ceilinged room. I stared around me, trying to find where her voice was coming from. Iheard her laugh, and I whirled to the sound. There she was, on the TV screen, tousling my hair in relief. It wasThanksgiving, and I was twelve. We'd gone to see my grandmother inCalifornia, the last year before she died. We went to the beach one day,and I'd leaned too far over the edge of the pier. She'd seen my feetflailing, trying to reclaim my balance. \"Bella? Bella? \" she'd called tome in fear. And then the TV screen was blue. I turned slowly. He was standing very still by the back exit, so still Ihadn't noticed him at first. In his hand was a remote control. We staredat each other for a long moment, and then he smiled. He walked toward me, quite close, and then passed me to put the remotedown next to the VCR. I turned carefully to watch him. \"Sorry about that, Bella, but isn't it better that your mother didn'treally have to be involved in all this? \" His voice was courteous, kind. And suddenly it hit me. My mother was safe. She was still in Florida. She'd never gotten my message. She'd never been terrified by the dark redeyes in the abnormally pale face before me. She was safe. \"Yes,\" I answered, my voice saturated with relief. \"You don't sound angry that I tricked you. \"\f\"I'm not. \" My sudden high made me brave. What did it matter now? It wouldsoon be over. Charlie and Mom would never be harmed, would never have tofear. I felt almost giddy. Some analytical part of my mind warned me thatI was dangerously close to snapping from the stress. \"How odd. You really mean it. \" His dark eyes assessed me with interest. The irises were nearly black, just a hint of ruby around the edges. Thirsty. \"I will give your strange coven this much, you humans can bequite interesting. I guess I can see the draw of observing you. It'samazing — some of you seem to have no sense of your own self-interest atall. \"He was standing a few feet away from me, arms folded, looking at mecuriously. There was no menace in his face or stance. He was so veryaverage-looking, nothing remarkable about his face or body at all. Justthe white skin, the circled eyes I'd grown so used to. He wore a paleblue, long-sleeved shirt and faded blue jeans. \"I suppose you're going to tell me that your boyfriend will avenge you? \"he asked, hopefully it seemed to me. \"No, I don't think so. At least, I asked him not to. \"\"And what was his reply to that? \"\"I don't know. \" It was strangely easy to converse with this genteelhunter. \"I left him a letter. \"\"How romantic, a last letter. And do you think he will honor it? \" Hisvoice was just a little harder now, a hint of sarcasm marring his politetone. \"I hope so. \"\"Hmmm. Well, our hopes differ then. You see, this was all just a littletoo easy, too quick. To be quite honest, I'm disappointed. I expected amuch greater challenge. And, after all, I only needed a little luck. \"I waited in silence. \"When Victoria couldn't get to your father, I had her find out more aboutyou. There was no sense in running all over the planet chasing you downwhen I could comfortably wait for you in a place of my choosing. So,after I talked to Victoria, I decided to come to Phoenix to pay yourmother a visit. I'd heard you say you were going home. At first, I neverdreamed you meant it. But then I wondered. Humans can be verypredictable; they like to be somewhere familiar, somewhere safe. Andwouldn't it be the perfect ploy, to go to the last place you should bewhen you're hiding — the place that you said you'd be. \"But of course I wasn't sure, it was just a hunch. I usually get afeeling about the prey that I'm hunting, a sixth sense, if you will. Ilistened to your message when I got to your mother's house, but of courseI couldn't be sure where you'd called from. It was very useful to haveyour number, but you could have been in Antarctica for all I knew, andthe game wouldn't work unless you were close by. \"Then your boyfriend got on a plane to Phoenix. Victoria was monitoringthem for me, naturally; in a game with this many players, I couldn't beworking alone. And so they told me what I'd hoped, that you were hereafter all. I was prepared; I'd already been through your charming homemovies. And then it was simply a matter of the bluff. \"Very easy, you know, not really up to my standards. So, you see, I'mhoping you're wrong about your boyfriend. Edward, isn't it? \"I didn't answer. The bravado was wearing off. I sensed that he was comingto the end of his gloat. It wasn't meant for me anyway. There was noglory in beating me, a weak human. \"Would you mind, very much, if I left a little letter of my own for your\fEdward? \"He took a step back and touched a palm-sized digital video camerabalanced carefully on top of the stereo. A small red light indicated thatit was already running. He adjusted it a few times, widened the frame. Istared at him in horror. \"I'm sorry, but I just don't think he'll be able to resist hunting meafter he watches this. And I wouldn't want him to miss anything. It wasall for him, of course. You're simply a human, who unfortunately was inthe wrong place, at the wrong time, and indisputably running with thewrong crowd, I might add. \"He stepped toward me, smiling. \"Before we begin…\"I felt a curl of nausea in the pit of my stomach as he spoke. This wassomething I had not anticipated. \"I would just like to rub it in, just a little bit. The answer was thereall along, and I was so afraid Edward would see that and ruin my fun. Ithappened once, oh, ages ago. The one and only time my prey escaped me. \"You see, the vampire who was so stupidly fond of this little victim madethe choice that your Edward was too weak to make. When the old one knew Iwas after his little friend, he stole her from the asylum where he worked— I never will understand the obsession some vampires seem to form withyou humans — and as soon as he freed her he made her safe."

I recognized thereasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothedher. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, roundclock on the wall. \"Do you need to go? \"She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while… I didn'tknow you were going to wake up…\"\"No problem, Mom. \" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't gether feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone. \"\"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced,proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home — I'll nevernotice. \" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard toconcentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime inthe neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone. \"\"Crime? \" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the houseand burned it to the ground — there's nothing left at all! And they lefta stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dancethere, honey? \"\"I remember. \" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me. \"\"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me. \"She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be backtonight. \" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise,and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom. \"\"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, Idon't want to lose you. \"Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My motherkissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there. \"\"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in aminute. \"As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car? \" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast. \"\"How was your nap? \" I asked. \"Interesting. \" His eyes narrowed. \"What? \"He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida… andyour mother… well, I thought that's what you would want. \"I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day inFlorida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a realvampire. \"\fHe almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I wouldstay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplacewhere I couldn't hurt you anymore. \"It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as thewords one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. Iwas barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as mybreathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in myprotesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that hadnothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse,threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward satstill as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye beforeturning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart? \" she asked kindly, tapping the IVfeed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don'tneed anything. \" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressedout; you need to rest. \" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready. \"She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at themachinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down. \"\"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedateyou. \"But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella. \" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll beright here as long as you need me. \"\"Do you swear you won't leave me? \" I whispered. I tried to control thegasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close tomine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear. \"The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of mybreathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed andthe beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer toblack than gold today. \"Better? \" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought Ipicked out the word \"overreaction. \"\"Why did you say that? \" I whispered, trying to keep my voice fromshaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want meto go away? \"\"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational. And I have no problem with saving you, either — if it weren't for thefact that I was the one putting you in danger… that I'm the reason that\fyou're here. \"\"Yes, you are the reason. \" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here — alive. \"\"Barely. \" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster andhardly able to move. \"\"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said,growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others — you can take yourpick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forkscemetery. \"He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted asif I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor… crumpled andbroken. \" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not evenhearing you scream in pain — all those unbearable memories that I'llcarry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling…knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill youmyself. \"\"But you didn't. \"\"I could have. So easily. \"I knew I needed to stay calm… but he was trying to talk himself intoleaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out. \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What? \"\"You know what. \" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornlydetermined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to bestrong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get yourway… whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good. \" He hadn't promised, though — a fact that I had not missed. Thepanic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control theanger. \"You told me how you stopped… now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why? \" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I wouldbe just like you. \"Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this wassomething he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have beenpreoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself… or she'd been verycareful with her thoughts around him — clearly, he'd had no idea thatshe'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He wassurprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if itwas chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience withrelationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical… a man and woman haveto be somewhat equal… as in, one of them can't always be swooping in andsaving the other one. They have to save each other equally. \"He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided hewasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before hecaught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too. \"\f\"You don't know what you're asking. \" His voice was soft; he staredintently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do. \"\"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this,and I'm still not sure. \"\"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you? \"\"No, I don't wish that. \" He paused before continuing. \"But my life wasover. I wasn't giving anything up. \"\"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose. \" I wasgetting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you. \"\"Why not? \" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meantthem to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it wasa few days ago… anyway, after that, it should be nothing. \"He glared at me. \"And the pain? \" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression fromshowing how clearly I remembered the feeling… the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it. \"\"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity. \"\"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal. \"Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informedthan he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger,watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie? \" he asked curtly. \"Renée? \"Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I openedmy mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and hisexpression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was asunconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Renée has always made thechoices that work for her — she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie'sresilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of themforever. I have my own life to live. \"\"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you. \"\"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! Iwas just there! \"\"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain ittriggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromisein his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not. \"His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two…\"\"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die. \"\"Really, Bella. \" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few\fdays. Two week at most. \"I glared at him. \"I may not die now… but I'm going to die sometime. Everyminute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old. \"He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to histemples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How itshould happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist — and Ishouldn't exist. \"I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid."

He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against thewall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, stillapprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey. \" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine intomy tube. \"You'll feel better now. \"\"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feelthe drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched myface. \"Stay. \" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like Isaid, as long as it makes you happy… as long as it's what's best for you. \"I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"'S not the same thing,\"I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with mewhen you wake up. \"I think I smiled. '\"Kay. \"I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too. \"\"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly… searching. He knew what I was after. His lips\ftouched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime. \"I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stuporweakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward? \" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes? \"\"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me. Epilogue：An Occasion\n    Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silkand chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styledcurls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back outthe long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on? \" I askedgrumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. \"I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet. \" He threw a mockingsmile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I everget used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I? \" I verified. \"Yes. \" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and,with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutelysurreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearinga tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as myother foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel,held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as Itried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like GuineaPig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day inAlice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she playedhairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, shereminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and askedme not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the mostridiculous dress — deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with Frenchtags I couldn't read — a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless…but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head. I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled hiscell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the callerID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie? \" I frowned. Charlie had been… difficult since my return to Forks. He had\fcompartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. TowardCarlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he wasstubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault — because, if not for him,I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far fromdisagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before:\n　　curfews… visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, andthen a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding! \" He laughed. \"What is it? \" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him? \" Edward suggested withevident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen. \" His voice was very friendly, onthe surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. Whatwas Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. Ilooked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella isunavailable tonight. \" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voicewas suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest,she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself isconcerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening. \" He didn't soundsorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on hisface. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel therage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn'tmean to offend you. \"I ignored that. \"You're taking me to the prom! \" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention atall, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decoratedthe school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjectingme to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressedhis lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella. \"My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me? \" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we weredoing? \"I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also becausethe vague suspicions — expectations, really — that I'd been forming allday, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wideof the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That wasthe furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that Iwas very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under myeyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled itaway; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying? \" he demanded infrustration. \"Because I'm mad! \"\f\"Bella. \" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What? \" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with himwhen he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'llprobably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap! \" Iheld out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm. \" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me tothank Alice for that tonight. \"\"Alice is going to be there? \" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett… and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress withRosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around — he thought my bizarre human reactionswere hilarious… or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot thathe found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook myhead to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought ofsomething else. \"Is Charlie in on this? \" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course. \" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't,though. \"I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I wereinseparable — except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous inthe parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlightescaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out hishand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge ofsmugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. Hecouldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd beenalone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion — andthen when someone mentions dancing…\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you — not even yourself. I won't let goof you once, I promise. \"I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that inmy face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad. \" He leaned down andwrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him liftme from the car."

                "text": "He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward theschool. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in thegym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for adance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches\fand twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table — he wascarrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feetforward — \"there are more than enough vampires present. \"I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of thefloor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed tothe sides of the room to give them space — no one wanted to stand incontrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating andflawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dresswith geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy whiteskin. And Rosalie was… well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vividscarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into awide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitiedevery girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspectingtownsfolk? \" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme? \" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course. \"He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing. \"\"Anything. \"He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringedagainst his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly —if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watchedin horror. \"Edward. \" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestlycan't dance! \" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can. \" He put my arms aroundhis neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes ofeffortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, sothat my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement — I smiledback. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself… alittle. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it? \" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by thespinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black,not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hairsmoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad forJacob. He was clearly uncomfortable — excruciatingly so. His face wasapologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave! \" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you. \"Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident onhis face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here. \" Jacob sounded like he'dbeen hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever. \"Hi, Jacob. \" I smiled back. \"What's up? \"\"Can I cut in? \" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the firsttime. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He musthave grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was toset me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on hisshoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now? \"He was smug. \"Six-two. \"We weren't really dancing — my leg made that impossible. Instead weswayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was justas well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly anduncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight? \" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom? \" headmitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, atleast. Seen anything you like? \" I teased, nodding toward a group of girlslined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken. \"He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second — then we bothlooked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here? \" I asked quickly,though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away,uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. Iswear the old man is losing his mind. \"I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me thatmaster cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished. \" I grinned back. Atleast Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a biteasier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own faceexpressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timidspeculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay? \"\f\"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't evenbe mad at Billy. Just say what you have to. \"\"Well — this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella — he wants you to break upwith your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please. '\" He shook his headin disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh? \"\"Yeah. He was… kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. Hedidn't believe…\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell. \"\"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt. \" It wasn't aquestion, and despite my promise, I was angry. Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to themusic, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so youknow\" — he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in myvoice — \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and hisfather, I'd be dead. \"\"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affectedhim some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At anyrate, you get your parts, right? \"\"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward… upset. \"There's more? \" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself. \"I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob. \"\"It's so bad. \"\"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay… but, geez, this sounds bad. \" He shook his head. \"He said to tellyou, no, to warn you, that — and this is his plural, not mine\" — helifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air— '\"We'll be watching. '\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much. \" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraisingas they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said tobutt the hell out? \" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well. \"The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do youwant to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere? \"Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here. \"Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around,Bella. \" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later. \"\"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a littleup-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leanedmy head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better? \" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me forCharlie's sake. It's nothing personal. \"\"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son isirritating me. \"I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why? \"\"First of all, he made me break my promise. \"I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" heexplained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you. \"\"Thanks. But there's something else. \" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're muchmore than beautiful. \"I laughed. \"You might be a little biased. \"\"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight. \"We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this? \" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepepaper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning methrough the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse ofJessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and Ismiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy inthe arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a headlower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, withConner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we wereoutdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried meacross the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow ofthe madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his faceglowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point? \" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfectthe day is, it always has to end. \"\f\"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantlytense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering myquestion, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want mypresence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you tobe human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died innineteen-eighteen like I should have. \"I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In whatstrange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own freewill? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would neverhave let you get away with this. \"He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, yousaid so yourself. \"\"That's because I was with you. \"We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. Iwished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in anormal human life. \"Will you tell me something? \" he asked, glancing down at me with a slightsmile. \"Don't I always? \"\"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine."
