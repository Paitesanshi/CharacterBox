Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. txt\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\nCHAPTER ONE\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something. . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking. . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that. . . but all the same, those people in cloaks. . . He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day! \"\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \"Shoo! \" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't! \"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern. \" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim? \"\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight. \"\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters. . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you? \"\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why? \"\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls. . . shooting stars. . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today. . . \"\n\"So? \" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \"Well, I just thought. . . maybe. . . it was something to do with. . . you know. . . her crowd. \"\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter. \" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he? \"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it? \"\n\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me. \"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree. \"\nHe didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did. . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them. . . . How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots."

She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't! \"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern. \" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim? \"\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight. \"\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters. . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you? \"\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why? \"\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls. . . shooting stars. . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today. . . \"\n\"So? \" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \"Well, I just thought. . . maybe. . . it was something to do with. . . you know. . . her crowd. \"\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter. \" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he? \"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it? \"\n\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me. \"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree. \"\nHe didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did. . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them. . . . How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots."

Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived! \"\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now! \"\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up! \" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet? \" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday. \"\nHarry groaned. \"What did you say? \" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing. . . \"\nDudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions. \"\nDon't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair! \" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put\ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year. \"\n\"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy. \"\n\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty. . . \"\n\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh. \" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then. \"\nUncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley! \" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him. \" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what? \" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy. \"\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne? \"\n\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins? \" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . . \"\n\"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . . \"\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day! \" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I. . . don't. . . want. . . him. . . t-t-to come! \" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything! \" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they're here! \" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas. \"\n\"I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly. . But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar. \" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong."

                "text": "He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\nMr. H. Potter\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n4 Privet Drive\nLittle Whinging\n Surrey\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy! \" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs? \" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --. \"\n\"Dad! \" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry's got something! \"\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \"That's mine! \" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \"Who'd be writing to you? \" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \"P-P-Petunia! \" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon! \"\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine. \"\n\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn't move. I WANT MY LETTER! \" he shouted. \"Let me see it! \" demanded Dudley. \"OUT! \" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house? \"\n\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want --\"\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer. . . Yes, that's best. . . we won't do anything. . . . \"But --\"\n\"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense? \"\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \"Where's my letter? \" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who's writing to me? \"\n\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it. \"\n\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it. \"\n\"SILENCE! \" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking. . . you're really getting a bit big for it. . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom. \"Why? \" said Harry. \"Don't ask questions! \" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now. \"\nThe Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there. . . I need that room. . . make him get out. . . . \"\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'\"\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in his hand. \"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley -- go -- just go. \"\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --\nHarry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. I want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up. \"\n\"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon. \"\n\"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly? \" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. \"Out! OUT! \"\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments! \"\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake'em off. . . shake 'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . . They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk. \"\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\nMr. H. Potter\nRoom 17\nRailview Hotel\nCokeworth\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \"I'll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear? \" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her."

                "text": "\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts. \" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \"Hogwarts, clear? \" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \"\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow. \"\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \"Have you got your own broom? \" the boy went on. \"No,\" said Harry. \"Play Quidditch at all? \"\n\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you? \" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \"I say, look at that man! \" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. \"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. \"He works at Hogwarts. \"\n\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he? \"\n\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed. \"\n\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. \"Do you? \" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents? \"\n\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren't they? \"\n\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean. \"\n\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway? \"\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \"What's up? \" said Hagrid. \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch? \"\n\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch! \"\n\"Don't make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's. \"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in. \"\n\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister! \"\n\"So what is Quidditch? \"\n\"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules. \" \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff? \"\n\"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --\"\n\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily. \"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one. \"\n\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts? \"\n\"Years an' years ago,\" said Hagrid. They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley. \"\n\"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level. \"\nHagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again. \"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present. \"\nHarry felt himself go red. \"You don't have to --\"\n\"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'. \"\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \"Don' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand. \"\nA magic wand. . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B. C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. \"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter. \" It wasn't a question. \"You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work. \"\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course. \"\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. \"And that's where. . . \"\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger. \"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands. . . well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . . \"\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid. \"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it? \"\n\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. \"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled? \" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. \"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I've still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly. \"But you don't use them? \" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see. \" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm? \"\n\"Er -- well, I'm right-handed,\" said Harry. \"Hold out your arm. That's it. \" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand. \"\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr."

Go on, go on, try it out. \"\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple. \"\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well. . . how curious. . . how very curious. . . \"\nHe put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious. . . curious. . \"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what's curious? \"\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar. \"\nHarry swallowed. \"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great. \"\nHarry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \"Everyone thinks I'm special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander. . . but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died. \"\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact. \"\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry. \"\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. CHAPTER SIX\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\nHarry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \"Er -- Uncle Vernon? \"\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts. \"\nUncle Vernon grunted again. \"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift? \"\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \"Thank you. \"\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they? \"\nHarry didn't say anything. \"Where is this school, anyway? \"\n\"I don't know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\" he read. His aunt and uncle stared. \"Platform what? \"\n\"Nine and three-quarters. \"\n\"Don't talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters. \"\n\"It's on my ticket. \"\n\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother. \"\n\"Why are you going to London? \" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings. \"\nHarry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they? \"\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \"Now, what's the platform number? \" said the boys' mother. \"Nine and three-quarters! \" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can't I go. . . \"\n\"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first. \"\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \"I'm not Fred, I'm George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George? \"\n\"Sorry, George, dear. \"\n\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too. \"\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to --\"\n\"How to get onto the platform? \" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important."

His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too. \"\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to --\"\n\"How to get onto the platform? \" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important."

                "text": "Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron. \"\n\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --\nIt didn't come. . . he kept on running. . . he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again. \"\n\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \"Give us a look, Lee, go on. \"\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \"Want a hand? \" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier. \"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help! \"\nWith the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \"What's that? \" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's lightning scar. \"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you\n\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren't you? \" he added to Harry. \"What? \" said Harry. \"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins. \"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am. \"\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door. \"Fred? George? Are you there? \"\n\"Coming, Mom. \"\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \"Ron, you've got something on your nose. \"\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free. \"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie? \" said one of the twins. \"Shut up,\" said Ron. \"Where's Percy? \" said their mother. \"He's coming now. \"\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \"Can't stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --\"\n\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy? \" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea. \"\n\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once --\"\n\"Or twice --\"\n\"A minute --\"\n\"All summer --\"\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway? \" said one of the twins. \"Because he's a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there. \"\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --\"\n\"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet. \"\n\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom. \"\n\"It's not funny. And look after Ron. \"\n\"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us. \"\n\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train? \"\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking. \"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is? \"\n\"Who? \"\n\"Harry Potter! \"\nHarry heard the little girl's voice. \"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please. . . . \"\n\"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know? \"\n\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning. \"\n\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform. \"\n\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like? \"\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern. \"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school. \"\n\"All right, keep your hair on. \"\nA whistle sounded. \"Hurry up! \" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls. \"\n\"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat. \"\n\"George! \"\n\"Only joking, Mom. \"\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \"Anyone sitting there? \" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full. \"\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \"Hey, Ron. \"\nThe twins were back. \"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there. \"\n\"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then. \"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \"Are you really Harry Potter? \" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. \"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got -- you know. . . \"\nHe pointed at Harry's forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \"So that's where You-Know-Who\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can't remember it. \"\n\"Nothing? \" said Ron eagerly. \"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else. \"\n\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \"Are all your family wizards? \" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him. \"\n\"So you must know loads of magic already. \"\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like? \"\n\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers. \"\n\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat. \"\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead. \"\nRon's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \". . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\nRon gasped. \"What? \" said Harry. \"You said You-Know-Who's name! \" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I'd have thought you, of all people --\"\n\"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn. . . . I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I'm the worst in the class. \"\n\"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough. \"\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears? \"\nHarry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \"Hungry, are you? \"\n\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don't like corned beef. \"\n\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty."

                "text": "\"Go on --\"\n\"You don't want this, it's all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn't got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us. \"\n\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \"What are these? \" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they? \" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa. \"\n\"What? \"\n\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy. \"\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \"So this is Dumbledore! \" said Harry. \"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore! \" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\nHarry turned over his card and read:\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared. \"He's gone! \"\n\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her. . . do you want it? You can start collecting. \"\nRon's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos. \"\n\"Do they? What, they don't move at all? \" Ron sounded amazed. \"weird! \"\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. \"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger- flavored one once. \"\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts. \"\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all? \"\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me! \"\n\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry. \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him. . . \"\nHe left. \"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk. \"\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. \"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look. . . \"\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway\nHe had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \"We've already told him we haven't seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then. \"\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \"Er -- all right. \"\nHe cleared his throat. \"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. \"\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \"Are you sure that's a real spell? \" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard -- I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you. She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either. \"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \"Are you really? \" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. \"Am I? \" said Harry, feeling dazed. \"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. . . . Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon. \"\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud. \"\n\"What house are your brothers in? \" asked Harry. \"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin. \"\n\"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in? \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway? \"\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school. \"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about\nGringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault. \"\nHarry stared. \"Really? What happened to them? \"\n\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it. \"\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \"What's your Quidditch team? \" Ron asked. \"Er -- I don't know any,\" Harry confessed. \"What! \" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley. \"Is it true? \" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. \"\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford. \"\nHe turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. \"\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you. \"\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up. \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you? \" Malfoy sneered. \"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some. \"\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \"What has been going on? \" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers."

                "text": "Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived. \"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing! \" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest. \"\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck. \"Wingardium Leviosa! \" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long. \"\n\"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa! \"\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \"Oh, well done! \" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it! \"\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly. \"\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears. \"I think she heard you. \"\n\"So? \" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must've noticed she's got no friends. \"\nHermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know. \"\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence. \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately! \"\nPercy was in his element. \"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect! \"\n\"How could a troll get in? \" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke. \"\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm. \"I've just thought -- Hermione. \"\n\"What about her? \"\n\"She doesn't know about the troll. \"\nRon bit his lip. \"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us. \"\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \"Percy! \" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \"What's he doing? \" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers? \"\n\"Search me. \"\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps. \"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \"Can you smell something? \"\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in. \"\n\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. 'Yes! \"\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \"It's the girls' bathroom! \" Harry gasped. \"Hermione! \" they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \"Confuse it! \" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \"Oy, pea-brain! \" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \"Come on, run, run! \" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa! \"\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \"Is it -- dead? \"\nI don't think so,\" said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out. \"\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh -- troll boogers. \"\nHe wiped it on the troll's trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind. \"What on earth were you thinking of? \" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory? \"\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me. \"\n\"Miss Granger! \"\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last. I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them. \"\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived. \"\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them. \"Well -- in that case. . . \" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own? \"\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses. \"\nHermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go. \"\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's. \"\n\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her. \"\n\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \"Pig snout,\" they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy."

                "text": "Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood. \"AAAAAAAAAARGH! \"\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear. Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \"Are you all right? \" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \"Yes -- thank you -- what was that? \"\nThe centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead. \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \"Firenze! \" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule? \"\n\"Do you realize who this is? \" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better. \"\n\"What have you been telling him? \" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets? \"\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice. Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest! \"\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \"Do you not see that unicorn? \" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must. \"\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. \"Why's Bane so angry? \" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway? \"\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions. \"\n\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips. \"\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \"But who'd be that desperate? \" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it? \"\n\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment? \"\n\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who --\"\n\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance? \"\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. \"\n\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\n\"Harry! Harry, are you all right? \"\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there. \"\n\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now. \"\nHarry slid off his back. \"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times. \"\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort. . . and Voldemort's waiting in the forest. . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. . . . \"\n\"Stop saying the name! \" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Harry wasn't listening. \"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so. . . . Bane was furious. . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort's coming back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that's written in the stars as well. \"\n\"Will you stop saying the name! \" Ron hissed. \"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy. \"\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic. \"\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over. When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\nJust in case. CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest. \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager. \"\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet. \"\nHarry was rubbing his forehead. \"I wish I knew what this means! \" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this. \"\n\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \"I'm not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it's a warning. . . it means danger's coming. . . . \"\nRon couldn't get worked up, it was too hot. \"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down. \"\nHarry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one. \"\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy. . . never. . . but --\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where're you going? \" said Ron sleepily. \"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now. \"\n\"Why? \" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before? \"\n\"What are you talking about?"

                "text": "\"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C's and a speeding cannonball. \"Ninth in the league. \"\nRon's school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron's magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion. \"It's a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I'm right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he's always banging on the pipes and groaning . . . . . . But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I've ever been in. \" Ron's ears went pink. . CHAPTER FOUR\nAT F L 0 V RR 11 $ H AND BLOTTS\nife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy! \" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. 42\n\"Fascinating. \" he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic. \"\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him. \"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \"Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry - doesn't miss a trick, that man. You two've got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas. For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year. SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\nby Miranda Goshawk\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\n4 \",3\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry's. \"You've been told to get all Lockhart's books, too! \" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it's a witch. \"\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother's eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. \"That lot won't come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his parents. \"Lockhart's books are really expensive . . . . . . \"Well, we'll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I expect we'll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny's things secondhand. \"\n\"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year? \" Harry asked Ginny. She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron's elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest. \"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day. \"\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a moulting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing. * 44\n\"Errol! \" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. \"Finally - he's got Hermione's answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys. \"\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic. \" Then he ripped open Hermione's letter and read it out loud:\n\"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there,\n\"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off. \"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be? \" said Ron in horror. \"We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley? \"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione. \"'\n\"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What're you all up to today? \"\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. * 4$\nThey couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He's not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O. WL. s and he hardly gloated at all. \"\n\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry's puzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we're not careful, we'll have another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame. \"\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard's bank, Gringotts. \"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything . . . . . . Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts\n46\nin Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. \"We're running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We'll have to buy some more today. . . Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear! \"\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot. Harry stared at them all watching him. \"W-what am I supposed to do? \" he stammered. \"He's never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry, Harry, I forgot. \"\n\"Never? \" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year? \"\n\"I went on the Underground -\"\n\"Really? \" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How exactly -\"\n\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -\"\n\"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first. \"\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley! \" and vanished. * 41\n\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right grate . . . . . . \"The right what? \" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too. \"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you've spoken clearly -\"\n\"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder, too. \"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle? \"\n\"They wouldn't mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -\"\n\"Well . . . all right . . . you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, when you get into the fire, say where you're going\n\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised. \"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\"\n\"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace -\"\n\"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George. \"\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. \"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed. 48\nIt felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening -he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap. Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye."

                "text": "He's been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\"\n. 125\n\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple. \"Filth! \" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. \"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter! \"\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. \"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains . . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's the form . . . yes . . . \"\n. 126\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot. \"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . . \"\n\"It was only a bit of mud! \" said Harry. \"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing! \"\nshouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. \"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . . \"\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall. But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. \"PEEVES! \" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I'll have you this time, I'll have you! \"\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry. Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic. . 127\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution! \" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell! \"\n Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a proper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. Filch was looking triumphant. \"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable! \" he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\"\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started. Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer. \"Have you - did you read -? \" he sputtered. . 128\n\"No,\" Harry lied quickly. Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together. \"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however -\"\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn't help. \"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -\"\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. \"Harry! Harry! Did it work? \"\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. \"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,\" said Nick eagerly. \"Thought it might distract him -\"\n\"Was that you? \" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get detention. Thanks, Nick! \"\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter. . . 129\n\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\"\nHarry said. Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower. \"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -\"\n\"What is it? \" said Harry. \"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. \"Right. \"\n\"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast? \" He watched Harry on tenterhooks. \"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -\"\n\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated, looking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me? \"\n\"Of - of course,\" said Harry. Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party? \" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've been to one of those - it'll be fascinating! \". . 130\n\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died? \" said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead depressing to me. . . . \"\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you'd go to the deathday party. \"\nSo at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. . 131\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. \"Is that supposed to be music? \" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. \"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . . . \"\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer. \"Shall we have a look around? \" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet. \"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts. . 132\n\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don't want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\"\n\"Who? \" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione. \"She haunts a toilet? \"\n\"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\"\n\"Look, food! \" said Ron. On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting."

                "text": "And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\n*301\nfeet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. \"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. \"Lumos! \" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . . . . . . But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. \"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder. They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving. \"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt. * 302 *\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly. There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way. \"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \"The adventure ends here, boys! \" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories! \"\nHe raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate! \"\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \"Ron! \" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron! \"\n\"I'm here! \" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='\n*303*\nThere was a dull thud and a loud \"ow! \" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. \"What now? \" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages . . . . . . Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in? There was another thud and another \"ow! \" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours . . . . Harry knew there was only one thing to do. \"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on. . . . If I'm not back in an hour. . . There was a very pregnant pause,\n\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\"\n\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice. And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. *304*\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive. He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. *306*\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. \"tinny! \" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be\n\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side. \"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him\n\"Tom - Tom Riddle? \"\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face. \"What d'you mean, she won't wake? \" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not -? \"\n\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just. \"\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \"Are you a ghost? \" Harry said uncertainly. * 30 7*\n\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years. He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with. \"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk . . . I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment . . . . Please, help me -1)\nRiddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again. But his wand had gone. \"Did you see -? \"\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. \"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\n\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly. Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer. \"What d'you mean? \" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\"\nRiddle's smile broadened. \"You won't be needing it,\" he said. *%08*\nHarry stared at him. \"What d'you mean, I won't be -? \"\n\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you. \"\n\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\n\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand. Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here . . . . \"How did Ginny get like this? \" he asked slowly. \"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger. \"\n\"What are you talking about? \" said Harry. \"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . . \"\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them. \"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom . . . . I'm so glad I've got this diary to\n*309*\nconfide in . . . . It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . . Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck. \"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted . . . . I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . . \"\n\"What d'you mean? \" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry. \" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter? \" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat. \"No,\" Harry whispered. \"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became . . . . Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he suspects me. . ."

                "text": "\"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you,\" said the manager lightly, looking to see what Harry was staring at. \"You'll start seeing death omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. \"\nBut Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. . . The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands. \"Anything else? \" he said. \"Yes,\" said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog's and dazedly consulting his booklist. \"Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three. \"\nHarry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people. He tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basin. \"It can't have been a death omen,\" he told his reflection defiantly. \"I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent. . . . It was probably just a stray dog. . . . \"\nHe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat\n\"You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,\" said his mirror in a vvheezy voice. As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking grandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he'd pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just wondering where he'd have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he turned. \"Harry! HARRY! \"\nThey were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown, both waving frantically at him. \"Finally! \" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \"We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --\"\n\"I got all my school stuff last week,\" Harry explained. \"And how come You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron? \" \"Dad,\" said Ron simply. Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge. \"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry? \" said Hermione in a very serious voice. \"I didn't mean to,\" said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. \"I just -- lost control. \"\n\"It's not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I'm amazed Harry wasn't expelled. \"\n\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested. \" He looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me off, does he? \"\n\"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it? \" shrugged Ron, still chuckling. \"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first, because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well! \"\nHermione nodded, beaming. \"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things. \"\n\"Excellent! \" said Harry happily. \"So, have you got all your new books and stuff? \"\n\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --\" He pointed at a large bag under his chair. \"What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two. \"\n\"What's all that, Hermione? \" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to her. ,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione. \"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --\"\n\"What are you doing Muggle Studies for? \" said Ron, rolling his eyes at Harry. \"You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles! \"\n\"But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view,\" said Hermione earnestly. \"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione? \" asked Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them. \"I've still got ten Galleons,\" she said, checking her purse. \"It's my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present. \"\n\"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently. \"No, I don't think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl. I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --\"\n\"I haven't,\" said Ron. \"Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers. \" He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I don't think Egypt agreed with him. \"\nScabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to his whiskers. \"There's a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they've got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,\"\nSo they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical Menagerie. There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages. A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long, bald tails. The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter. \"It's my rat,\" he told the witch. \"He been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt. \"\n\"Bang him on the counter,\" said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket. Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better took. Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone. \"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat? \"\n\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother. \"\n\"What powers does he have? \" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely. \"Er --\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly. \"He's been through the mill, this one,\" she said. \"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively. \"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live longer than three years or so,\" said the witch. \"Now, if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these --\"\nShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron muttered, \"Show-offs. \"\n\"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\" said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle. \"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH! \"\nRon buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers. \"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO! \" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door. \"Scabbers! \" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry followed. It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging his head. \"What was that? \"\n\"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\" said Harry. \"Where's Hermione? \"\n\"Probably getting her owl\nThey made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie. As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn't carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat. \"You bought that monster? \" said Ron, his mouth hanging open. \"He's gorgeous, isn't he? \" said Hermione, glowing. That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in Hermione's arms. \"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me! \" said Ron. \"He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks? \" said Hermione. \"And what about Scabbers? \" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest pocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How's he going to get it with that thing around? \"\n\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping the small red bottle into Ron's hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages; no one wanted him. \"\n\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky Cauldron. They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet. \"Harry! \" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you? \"\n\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley with A their shopping. Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him. \"They still haven't caught him, then? \" he asked. \"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They've pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far. \"\n\"Would we get a reward if we caught him? \" asked Ron. \"It'd be good to get some more money --\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. \"Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back, You mark my words. \"\nAt that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny."

                "text": "Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn't feel like working. He turned around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors. \"What are you doing? \" Filch snarled suspiciously. \"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully. \"Nothing! \" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \"A likely story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends? \"\nHarry shrugged. \"Well, get back to your common room where you belong! \" snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight. But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, \"Harry? \"\nHarry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin, looking around his office door. \"What are you doing? \" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from Filch. \"Where are Ron and Hermione? \"\n\"Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. \"Ah,\" said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \"Why don't you come in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson. \" \"A what? \" said Harry. I\nHe followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers. \"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \"We shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle. \"\nThe grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner. \"Cup of tea? \" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \"I was just thinking of making one. \"\n\"All right,\" said Harry awkwardly. Lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout. \"Sit down,\" said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \"I've only got teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves? \"\nHarry looked at him. Lupin's eyes were twinkling. \"How did you know about that? \" Harry asked. \"Professor McGonagall told me,\" said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug of tea. \"You're not worried, are you? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he'd seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn't want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn't cope with a boggart. Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because Lupin said, \"Anything worrying you, Harry? \"\n\"No,\" Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly, putting his tea down on Lupin's desk. \"You know that day we fought the boggart? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Lupin slowly. \"Why didn't you let me fight it? \" said Harry abruptly. Lupin raised his eyebrows. \"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\" he said, sounding surprised. Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was taken aback. \"Why? \" he said again. \"Well,\" said Lupin, frowning slightly, \"I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort. \"\nHarry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore. \"Clearly, I was wrong,\" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \"But I didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic. \"\n\"I didn't think of Voldemort,\" said Harry honestly. \"I -- I remembered those dementors. \"\n\"I see,\" said Lupin thoughtfully. \"Well, well. . . I'm impressed. \" fie smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. \"That suggests that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry. \"\nHarry didn't know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea. \"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting the boggart? \" said Lupin shrewdly. \"Well. . . yeah,\" said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier. \"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --\"\nHe was interrupted by a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Lupin. The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing. \"Ah, Severus,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me? \"\nSnape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin. \"I was just showing Harry my grindylow,\" said Lupin pleasantly, pointing at the tank. \"Fascinating,\" said Snape, without looking at it. \"You should drink that directly, Lupin. \"\n\"Yes, Yes, I will,\" said Lupin. \"I made an entire cauldronful,\" Snape continued. \"If you need more. \"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus. \"\n\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. \"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\" he said. \"I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex. \" He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \"Pity sugar makes it useless,\" he added, taking a sip and shuddering. \"Why --? \" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question. \"I've been feeling a bit off-color,\" he said. \"This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it. \"\nProfessor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands. \"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out. \"Really? \" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion. \"Some people reckon --\" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on, \"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. \"\nLupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. \"Disgusting,\" he said. \"Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see you at the feast later. \"\n\"Right,\" said Harry, putting down his empty teacup. The empty goblet was still smoking. \"There you go,\" said Ron. \"We got as much as we could carry. \"\nA shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps. \"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go? \"\nBy the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides. \"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there! \"\n\"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there's a bit, look --\"\n\"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks --\"\n\"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --\"\n\"What did you do? \" said Hermione, looking anxious. \"Did you get any work done? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in. . . . \"\nHe told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open. \"Lupin drank it? \" he gasped. \"Is he mad? \"\nHermione checked her watch. \"We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape. \"But if he -- you know\" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing nervously around -- \"if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn't have done it in front of Harry. \"\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes. The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin\nlooked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural? The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading. It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall, \"The dementors send their love, Potter! \"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students. \"Why isn't anyone going in? \" said Ron curiously. Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be closed. \"Let me through, please,\" came Percy's voice, and he came bustling importantly through the crowd. \"What's the holdup here? You can't all have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --\"\nAnd then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, \"Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick. \"\nPeople's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe. \"What's going on? \" said Ginny, who had just arrived. A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was. \"Oh, my --\" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm. The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely. Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying toward him. \"We need to find her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady. \"\n\"You'll be lucky! \" said a cackling voice. It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry. \"What do you mean, Peeves? \" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle. \"Ashamed, Your Headship, sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,\" he said happily. \"Poor thing,\" he added unconvincingly. \"Did she say who did it? \" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Oh yes, Professorhead,\" said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms. \"He got very angry when she wouldn't let him in, you see. \" Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from between his own legs. \"Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black."

He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding. . . . Any second now, he might hear his mother again. . . but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to. . . or did he? Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled. A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --\n\"Expecto patronum! \" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto --\"\nBut the classroom and the dementor were dissolving. . . . Harry was failing again through thick white fog, and his mother's voice was louder than ever, echoing inside his head -- \"Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll do anything! \"\n\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl! \"\n\"Harry! \"\nHarry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn't have to ask what had happened. \"Sorry,\" he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses. \"Are you all right? \" said Lupin. \"Yes. . . \" Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against it. \"Here --\" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had. \"\n\"It's getting worse,\" Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. \"I could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\nLupin looked paler than usual. ,\n\"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --\"\n\"I do! \" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth. \"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we've lost the Quidditch Cup! \"\n\"All right then. . . \" said Lupin. \"You might want to select 'other memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on. . . . That one doesn't seem to have been strong enough. . . . \"\nHarry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroom. \"Ready? \" said Lupin, gripping the box lid. \"Ready,\" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box opened. \"Go! \" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry -\n\"Expecto patronum! \" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --\"\nWhite fog obscured his senses. . . big, blurred shapes were moving around him. . . then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --\n\"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --\"\nThe sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a cackle of high- pitched laughter --\n\"Harry! Harry. . . wake up. . . . \"\nLupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute before Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor. \"I heard my dad,\" Harry mumbled. \"That's the first time I've ever heard him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it. . . . \"\nHarry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see. \"You heard James? \" said Lupin in a strange voice. \"Yeah. . . \" Face dry, Harry looked up. \"Why -- you didn't know my dad, did you? \"\n\"I -- I did, as a matter of fact,\" said Lupin. \"We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced. . . . I shouln't have suggested putting you through this. . . . \"\n\"No! \" said Harry. He got up again. \"I'll have one more go! I'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is. . . . Hang on. . . . \"\nHe racked his brains. A really, really happy memory. . . one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus. . . The moment when he'd first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he didn't know what was. . . . Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he'd realized he'd be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more. \"Ready? \" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. \"Concentrating hard? All right -- go! \"\nHe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark\n'EXPECTO PATRONUM! \" Harry bellowed. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"\nThe screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer and louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry's wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though Harry's legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how much longer, he wasn't sure --\n\"Riddikulus! \" roared Lupin, springing forward. There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he'd just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again. \"Excellent! \" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \"Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start! \"\n\"Can we have another go? Just one more go? \"\n\"Not now,\" said Lupin firmly. \"You've had enough for one night. Here --\"\nHe handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate. \"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week? \"\n\"Okay,\" said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him. \"Professor Lupin? \" he said. \"If you knew my dad, you must've known Sirius Black as well. \"\nLupin turned very quickly. \"What gives you that idea? \" he said sharply. \"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too. . . . \"\nLupin's face relaxed. \"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late. \"\nHarry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn't mentioned Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts wandered back to his mother and father. . . He felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents' last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child. But he'd never be able to produce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents again. . . . \"They're dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"They're dead and listening to echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup. \"\nHe stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and headed back to Gryffindor Tower. Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted. \"How's she doing it? \" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books. \"Doing what? \"\n\"Getting to all her classes! \" Ron said. \"I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me she's never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she's never missed one of them either! \"\nHarry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape's essay. Two seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood. \"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first. \" Wood shook his head in disbelief. \"Honestly, the way she was yelling at me. . . you'd think I'd said something terrible. . . then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGonagall's severe voice. 'As long as necessary, Wood'. . . I reckon it's time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back of Which Broomstick. . . you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like Malfoy's got. \"\n\"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly. January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted. \"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told him the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth. \"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me. \"\nTo make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again. \"You're expecting too much of yourself,\" said Professor Lupin, sternly in their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement."

                "text": "\" Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \"On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt. \" He gave Harry's broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, \"Okay, everyone, let's go -- \"\nAnd at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground. It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again. \"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out! \" Wood called. Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand. The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her easily, and caught it again. It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first. \"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow! \" said Wood. \"Not unless -- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you? \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were stronger. \"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,\" said Fred confidently. \"Well, let's hope not,\" said Wood. \"Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's get back to the tower. . . turn in early --\"\n\"I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\" Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat. \"Here you go,\" said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt. Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle. Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness. Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs. \"What's the matter? \" said Ron. Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos! \"\nA beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was Crookshanks. \"Get out of here! \" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. \"See? \" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \"She's still letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now. . . . \"\nHarry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall. Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck. \"Did you see his face? \" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. \"He can't believe it! This is brilliant! \"\nWood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt. \"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt. \"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage! \" said Percy heartily as she examined the Firebolt closely. \"Penelope and I have got a bet on,\" he told the team. \"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match! \"\nPenelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to her table. \"Harry -- make sure you win,\" said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \"I haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny! \" And-he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast. \"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter? \" said a cold, drawling voice. Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right behind him. \"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually. \"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it? \" said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in case you get too near a dementor. \"\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered. \"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then it could catch the Snitch for you. \"\nThe Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's broom really was a Firebolt. At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze; there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching. \"You know what we've got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just -- just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay! \"\nThey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves. \"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain. \"Mount your brooms. . . on my whistle. . . three -- two -- one --\"\nHarry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan. \"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship --\"\n\"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match? \" interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice. \"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information -- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --\"\n\"Jordan! \"\n\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal. . . \"\nHarry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction. \"Show her your acceleration, Harry! \" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia. Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the barriers. Harry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was ten feet away --\nThen a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished. There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid it. \"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn -- Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance is really noticeable in these long --\"\n\"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY! \"\nRavenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --\nHarry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --\n\"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN! \" Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO! \"\nHarry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had vanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him. . . . She'd decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch herself. . . All right, then. . . if she wanted to tail him, she'd have to take the consequences. . . . He dived again, and Cho, thinking he'd seen the Snitch, tried to follow; Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end. He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on the Snitch with every second -- then --\n\"Oh! \" screamed Cho, pointing. Distracted, Harry looked down. Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him. He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum! \"\nSomething silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch. Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd. \"That's my boy! \" Wood kept yelling."

THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTS AID, GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT. . . BEFORE MIDNIGHT. . . THE SERVANT. . . WILL SET OU. . . TO REJOIN. . . HIS MASTER. . . . Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her chest. She made a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite suddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again. \"I'm so sorry, dear boy,\" she said dreamily, \"the heat of the day, you know. . . I drifted off for a moment. . . . \"\nHarry sat there, staring at her. \"Is there anything wrong, my dear? \"\n\"You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise again. . . that his servant's going to go back to him. Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled. \"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's hardly something to joke about. . . . Rise again, indeed --\"\n,'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --\"\n\"I think you must have dozed off too, dear! \" said Professor Trelawney. \"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched as that! \"\nHarry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, wondering. . . had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real prediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test? Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words still resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner, however, sat Ron and Hermione. \"Professor Trelawney,\" Harry panted, \"just told me --\"\nBut he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces. \"Buckbeak lost,\" said Ron weakly. \"Hagrid's just sent this. \"\nHagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible. Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do. Don't come down. I don't want you to see it. Hagrid\n\"We've got to go,\" said Harry at once. \"He can't just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner! \"\n\"Sunset, though,\" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way. \"We'd never be allowed. . . 'specially you, Harry. . . . \"\nHarry sank his head into his hands, thinking. \"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak. . . . \"\n\"Where is it? \" said Hermione. Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch. \". . . if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious trouble,\" he finished. \"That's true,\" said Hermione, getting to her feet. \"If he sees you. . . . How do you open the witch's hump again? \"\n\"You -- you tap it and say, 'Dissendium,'\" said Harry. \"But --\"\nHermione didn't wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight. \"She hasn't gone to get it? \" Ron said, staring after her. She had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes. \"Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately! \" said Ron, astounded. \"First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney --\"\nHermione looked rather flattered. They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door. \"Okay,\" she whispered, \"no one there -- cloak on --\"\nWalking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees. They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering, and when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and trembling. \"It's us,\" Harry hissed. \"We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off. \"\n\"Yeh shouldn've come! \" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the cloak. Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears. \"Wan' some tea? \" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle. \"Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid? \" said Hermione hesitantly. I -- I took him outside,\" said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug. \"He's tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he oughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before\nHagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor. \"I'll do it, Hagrid,\" said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess. \"There's another one in the cupboard,\" Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly. \"Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid? \" Harry asked fiercely, sitting down next to him. \"Dumbledore --\"\n\"He's tried,\" said Hagrid. \"He's got no power ter overrule the Committee. He told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared. . . . Yeh know what Lucius Malfoy's like. . . threatened 'em, I expect. . . an' the executioner, Macnair, he's an old pal o' Malfoy's. . . but it'll be quick an' clean. . . an' I'll be beside him. . . . \"\nHagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort. \"Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me this mornin'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man, Dumbledore. . . . \"\nHermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the new jug in her hands, fighting back tears. \"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid,\" she began, but Hagrid shook his shaggy head. \"Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway. . . If Fudge an' Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in big trouble. \"\nSilent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she hid them from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek. \"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers! \"\nRon gaped at her. \"What are you talking about? \"\nHermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table. \"Scabbers! \" said Ron blankly. \"Scabbers, what are you doing here? \"\nHe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron's hands as though desperate to free himself\n\"It's okay, Scabbers! \" said Ron. \"No cats! There's nothing here to hurt you! \"\nHagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment. \"They're comin'. . . . \"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge. Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner, Macnair. \"Yeh gotta go,\" said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. \"They mustn' find yeh here. . . . Go now. . . \"\nRon stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak. \"I'll let yeh out the back way,\" said Hagrid. They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously. \"It's okay, Beaky,\" said Hagrid softly. \"It's okay. . . \" He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Get goin'. \"\nBut they didn't move. \"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\"We'll tell them what really happened --\"\n\"They can't kill him --\"\n\"Go! \" said Hagrid fiercely. \"It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all! \"\nThey had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight. \"Go quick,\" he said hoarsely. \"Don' listen. . . . \"\nAnd he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door. Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, the front door closed with a sharp snap. \"Please, let's hurry,\" Hermione whispered. \"I can't stand it, I can't bear it. . . . \"\nThey started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the west there was a ruby-red glow. Ron stopped dead. \"Oh, please, Ron,\" Hermione began. \"It's Scabbers -- he won't -- stay put --\"\nRon was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron's hand. \"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron,\" Ron hissed. They heard a door open behind them and men's voices. \"Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it! \" Hermione breathed. \"Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --\"\nThey walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again. \"I can't hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --\"\nThe rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe. Hermione swayed on the spot. \"They did it! \" she whispered to Harry. \"I d -- don't believe it -- they did it! \"\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\nCAT, RAT, AND DOG\nHarry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling. \"Hagrid,\" Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms. \"We can't,\" said Ron, who was paper-white. \"He'll be in worse trouble if they know we've been to see him. . . . \"\nHermione's breathing was shallow and uneven. \"How -- could -- they? \" she choked. \"How could they? \"\n\"Come on,\" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering."

                "text": "\"\nThe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly. Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow. Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up. \"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh! \"\nSnape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak. \"So that's it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We're all down there. . . and now we've just got to wait until we come back up again. . . . \"\nShe took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees. \"Harry, there's something I don't understand. . . . Why didn't the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out. . . there were so many of them. . . . \"\nHarry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat. Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished. \"But what was it? \"\n\"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\" said Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one. \"\n\"But who conjured it? \"\nHarry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been. . . but how could it have been? \"Didn't you see what they looked like? \" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it one of the teachers? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn't a teacher. \"\n\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away. . . If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see --? \"\n\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But. . . maybe I imagined it. . . . I wasn't thinking straight. . . . I passed out right afterward. . . . \"\n\"Who did you think it was? \"\nI think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. I think it was my dad. \"\nHarry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity. \"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly. \"I know that,\" said Harry quickly. \"You think you saw his ghost? \"\n\"I don't know. . . no. . . he looked solid. . . . \"\n\"But then --\"\n\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But. . . from what I could see. . . it looked like him. . . . I've got photos of him. . . . \"\nHermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity. I know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak. He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest friends. . . Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. . . . Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead. . . . Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly. . . yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness. . . . The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting. And then, at last, after over an hour. . . \"Here we come! \" Hermione whispered. She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots. Then came Hermione. . . then the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward the castle. Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon. . . . \"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking, \"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do. . . . \"\n\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again. . said Harry quietly. \"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark? \" snapped Hermione. \"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else! \"\n\"All right! \"\nThe moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --\n\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming\n\"Hermione! \" said Harry suddenly. \"We've got to move! \"\n\"We mustn't, I keep telling you --\"\n\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us! \"\nHermione gasped. \"Quick! \" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming any moment --\"\n\"Back to Hagrid's! \" Harry said. \"It's empty now -- come on! \"\nThey ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them. . . . The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly. \"Shh, Fang, it's us! \" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him. \"That was really close! \" she said to Harry. \"Yeah. . . \"\nHarry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap. \"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --\"\nHermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious. \"I'm not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to rescue Sirius? \"\n\"Well. . . okay, then. . . I'll wait here with Buckbeak. . . but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\nHarry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. . . . He and Hermione would be running to him any moment. . . . Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest. . . . Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any moment. . . . For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted to do the seeing. . . . He had to know. . . And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake. . . . They were moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank. . . . He wouldn't have to get near them. . . . Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father. . . If it was him. . . if it really was him. . . he had to know, had to find out. . . . The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own attempts at a Patronus --\nThere was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him -- any moment now --\n\"Come on! \" he muttered, staring about. \"Where are you? Dad, come on --\"\nBut no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this time --\nAnd then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he had seen himself --\nHarry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"he yelled. And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering, retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone. The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above . . . it was coming back to him. . . . It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head. And Harry realized. . . \"Prongs, \"he whispered. But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished. Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her. \"What did you do? \" she said fiercely. \"You said you were only going to keep a lookout! \"\n\"I just saved all our lives. . . ,\" said Harry. \"Get behind here -- behind this bush -- I'll explain. \"\nHermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again. \"Did anyone see you? \"\n\"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It's okay! \"\n\"Harry, I can't believe it. . . . You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I could do it this time,\" said Harry, \"because I'd already done it. . . . Does that make sense? \"\n\"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape! \"\nTogether they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle. \"Right, it's nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. \"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we're missing. . . . 11\nThey waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again. \"D' you reckon he's up there yet? \" said Harry, checking his watch. He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower. \"Look! \" Hermione whispered. \"\\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of the castle! \"\nHarry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt. \"Macnair! \" said Harry. \"The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione --\"\nHermione put her hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her a leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins. \"Ready? \" he whispered to Hermione."

Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories. \"What are Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes? \" Harry asked as they climbed. Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn't. \"Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George's room,\" said Ron quietly. \"Great long price lists for stuff they've invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they'd been inventing all that . . . \"\n\"We've been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\" said Ginny. \"We thought they just liked the noise. \"\n\"Only, most of the stuff - well, all of it, really - was a bit dangerous,\" said Ron, \"and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren't allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms. . . . She's furious at them anyway. They didn't get as many O. W. L. s as she expected. \"\nO. W. L. s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen. \"And then there was this big row,\" Ginny said, \"because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop. \"\nJust then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression. \"Hi, Percy,\" said Harry. \"Oh hello, Harry,\" said Percy. \"I was wondering who was making all the noise. I'm trying to work in here, you know I've got a report to finish for the office - and it's rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs. \"\n\"We're not thundering, \"said Ron irritably. \"We're walking. Sorry if we've disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic. \"\n\"What are you working on? \" said Harry. \"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,\" said Percy smugly. \"We're trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year -\"\n\"That'll change the world, that report will,\" said Ron. \"Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks. \"\nPercy went slightly pink. \"You might sneer, Ron,\" he said heatedly, \"but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger -\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, all right,\" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees. The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly. \"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" he told Harry. \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he's got to work. \"\n\"Er - why are you calling that owl Pig? \" Harry asked Ron. \"Because he's being stupid,\" said Ginny, \"Its proper name is Pigwidgeon. \"\n\"Yeah, and that's not a stupid name at all,\" said Ron sarcastically. \"Ginny named him,\"\nhe explained to Harry. \"She reckons it's sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won't answer to anything else. So now he's Pig. I've got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that. Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him. \"Where's Crookshanks? \" Harry asked Hermione now. \"Out in the garden, I expect,\" she said. \"He likes chasing gnomes. He's never seen any before. \"\n\"Percy's enjoying work, then? \" said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling. \"Enjoying it? \" said Ron darkly. \"I don't reckon he'd come home if Dad didn't make him. He's obsessed. Just don't get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They'll be announcing their engagement any day now. \"\n\"Have you had a good summer, Harry? \" said Hermione. \"Did you get our food parcels and everything? \"\n\"Yeah, thanks a lot, \" said Harry. \"They saved my life, those cakes. \"And have you heard from -? \" Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry's godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence. \"I think they've stopped arguing,\" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. \"Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner? \"\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. The four of them left Ron's room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered. \"We're eating out in the garden,\" she said when they came in. \"There's just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,\" she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling. \"Oh for heaven's sake,\" she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. \"Those two! \" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. I don't know what's going to happen to them, I really don't. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can. . . . \"\nMrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred. \"It's not as though they haven't got brains, she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \"but they're wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they'll be in real trouble. I've had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they're going, they'll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office. \"\nMrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan. \"I don't know where we went wrong with them,\" said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \"It's been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won't listen to - OH NOT AGAIN! \"\nShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse. \"One of their fake wands again! \" she shouted. \"How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around? \"\nShe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking. \"C'mon,\" Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \"let's go and help Bill and Charlie. \"\nThey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard. They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety. Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor. \"Will you keep it down? ! \" he bellowed. \"Sorry, Perce,\" said Bill, grinning. \"How're the cauldron bottoms coming on? \"\n\"Very badly,\" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere. By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and\nsalad. At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms. \"I've told Mr. Crouch that I'll have it ready by Tuesday,\" Percy was saying pompously. \"That's a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he'll be grateful I've done it in good time, I mean, its extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We're just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman -\"\n\"I like Ludo,\" said Mr. Weasley mildly. \"He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble - a lawnmower with unnatural powers - I smoothed the whole thing over. \"\n\"Oh Bagman's likable enough, of course,\" said Percy dismissively, \"but how he ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can't see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what's happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back? \"\n\"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"He says Bertha's gotten lost plenty of times before now - though must say, if it was someone in my department, I'd be worried. . . . \"\n\"Oh Bertha's hopeless, all right,\" said Percy."

Why's it such a big deal? \"\n\"I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts. \"\n\"And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again. \"\n\"I don't get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean. . . it's still only a shape in the sky. . . \"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. . . . \" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone's worst fear. . . the very worst. . There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right now. \"\n\"Death Eaters? \" said Harry. \"What are Death Eaters? \"\n\"It's what You-Know-Who's supporters called themselves,\" said Bill. \"I think we saw what's left of them tonight - the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway. \"\n\"We can't prove it was them, Bill,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Though it probably was,\" he added hopelessly. \"Yeah, I bet it was! \" said Ron suddenly . \"Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who! \"\n\"But what were Voldemort's supporters -\" Harry began. Everybody flinched - like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort's name. \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"What were You-Know-Who's supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point? \"\n\"The point? \" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. \"Harry, that's their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,\" he finished disgustedly. \"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark? \" said Ron. \"They'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they? \"\n\"Use your brains, Ron,\" said Bill. \"If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they'd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they'd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you? \"\n\"So. . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark. . . \" said Hermione slowly, \"were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away? \"\n\"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But I'll tell you this. . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I'd be very surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a Death Eater once, even if they're not now. . Listen, it's very late, and if your mother hears what's happened she'll be worried sick. We'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here. \"\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted:\nIt was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wide-awake, and worried. Three days ago - it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days - he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort's mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean? He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie's snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off. CHAPTER TEN - MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY\nMr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas. \"\n\"He'll be all right,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \"Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while. . . and that was a big thing they had to make him forget. \"\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane. \"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness! \"\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand. \"Arthur - I've been so worried - so worried-\"\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley's neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops. \"You're all right,\" Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, \"you're alive. . . . Oh boys. . And to everybody's surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together. \"Ouch! Mum - you're strangling us -\"\n\"I shouted at you before you left! \" Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. \"It's all I've\nbeen thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn't get enough OW. L. s? Oh Fred. . . George. . \"\n\"Come on, now, Molly, we're all perfectly okay,\" said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. \"Bill,\" he added in an undertone, \"pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . . \"\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder. \"I knew it,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Ministry blunders. . . culprits not apprehended. . . lax security. . . Dark wizards running unchecked. . . national disgrace. . . Who wrote this? Ah. . . of course. . . Rita Skeeter. \"\n\"That woman's got it in for the Ministry of Magic! \" said Percy furiously. \"Last week she was saying we're wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn't specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans --\"\n\"Do us a favor, Perce,\" said Bill, yawning, \"and shut up. \"\n\"I'm mentioned,\" said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article. \"Where? \" spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. \"If I'd seen that, I'd have known you were alive! \"\n\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen. ' Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods. . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she's printed that. \"\nHe heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I'm going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over. \"\n\"I'll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person. \"\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. \"Arthur, you're supposed to be on holiday! This hasn't got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you? \"\n\"I've got to go, Molly,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I've made things worse. I'll just change into my robes and I'll be off. . . . \"\n\"Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \"Hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me, has she? \"\n\"Hedwig, dear? \" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \"No. . . no, there hasn't been any post at all. \"\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron? \"\n\"Yeah. . . think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione? \"\n\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs. \"What's up, Harry? \" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them. \"There's something I haven't told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again. \"\nRon's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck. \"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he? \"\n\"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him. . . him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill. . . someone. \"\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn't bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did. \"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare. \"\n\"Yeah, but was it, though? \" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It's weird, isn't it? . . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again. \"\n\"Don't - say - his - name! \" Ron hissed through gritted teeth. \"And remember what Professor Trelawney said? \" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year? \"\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts."

                "text": "\"\n\"Hermione - open your ears,\" said Ron loudly. \"They. Like. It. They like being enslaved! \"\n\"Our short-term aims,\" said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, \"are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,\nbecause they're shockingly underrepresented. \"\n\"And how do we do all this? \" Harry asked. \"We start by recruiting members,\" said Hermione happily. \"I thought two Sickles to join -that buys a badge - and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You're treasurer, Ron - I've got you a collecting tin upstairs - and Harry, you're secretary, so you might want to write down everything I'm saying now, as a record of our first meeting. \"\nThere was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron's face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill. \"Hedwig! \" he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window. Hedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry's predictions. \"About time! \" said Harry, hurrying after her. \"She's got an answer! \" said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig's leg. Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly. \"What does it say? \" Hermione asked breathlessly. The letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:\nHarry - I'm flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore -they're saying he's got Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he's reading the signs, even if no one else is. I'll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open, Harry. Sirius Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him. \"He's flying north? \" Hermione whispered. \"He's coming back? \"\n\"Dumbledore's reading what signs? \" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"Harry - what's up? \"\nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap. \"I shouldn't've told him! \" Harry said furiously. \"What are you on about? \" said Ron in surprise. \"It's made him think he's got to come back! \" said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron's chair, hooting indignantly. \"Coming back, because he thinks I'm in trouble! And there's nothing wrong with me! And I haven't got anything for you,\" Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, \"you'll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food. \"\nHedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went. \"Harry,\" Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice. \"I'm going to bed,\" said Harry shortly. \"See you in the morning. \"\nUpstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-poster, but he didn't feel remotely tired. If Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry's, fault. Why hadn't he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds' pain and he'd had to blab. . . . If he'd just had the sense to keep it to himself. He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville's usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake. CHAPTER FIFTEEN - BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG\nEarly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as\nthough his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:\nDear Sirius, I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time. There's no point coming back, everything's fine here. Don't worry about me, my head feels completely normal. Harry He then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower. The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor. It took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it. \"Just find him, all right? \" Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \"Before the dementors do. \"\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius's reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them. \"That was a lie, Harry,\" said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \"You didn't imagine your scar hurting and you know it. \"\n\"So what? \" said Harry. \"He's not going back to Azkaban because of me. \"\n\"Drop it,\" said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent. Harry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody's Defense Against the Dark Arts. To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects. \"But - but you said it's illegal, Professor,\" said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \"You said - to use it against another human was -\"\n\"Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\" said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \"If you'd rather learn the hard way - when someone's putting it on you so they can control you completely - fine by me. You're excused. Off you go. \"\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson. Moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it. \"Potter,\" Moody growled, \"you next. \"\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, '1mperio! \"\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him. And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk. . . jump onto the desk. . . Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring. Jump onto the desk. . . . Why, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain. Stupid thing to do, really, said the voice. Jump onto the desk. . . . No, I don't think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly. . . no, I don't really want to. Jump! NOW! The next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping - the result was that he'd smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps. \"Now, that's more like it! \" growled Moody's voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double. \"Look at that, you lot. . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We'll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention - watch his eyes, that's where you see it - very good, Potter, very good indeed! They'll have trouble controlling you! \"\n\"The way he talks,\" Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), \"you'd think we were all going to be attacked any second. \"\n\"Yeah, I know,\" said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. \"Talk about paranoid. . . \" Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. \"No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted 'Boo' behind him on April Fools' Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we've got to do? \"\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned. \"You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education! \" she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. \"Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer --\"\n\"We don't take O. W. L. s till fifth year! \" s aid Dean Thomas indignantly. \"Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin! \"\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself. Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class."

                "text": "\"\nVery glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, hooking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting - Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment. \"May I introduce Mr. Ollivander? \" said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges' table and talking to the champions. \"He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament. \"\nHarry hooked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before - he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley. \"Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please? \" said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room. Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Olhivander and handed him her wand. \"Hmm. . . \" he said. He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully. \"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"nine and a half inches. . . inflexible. . rosewood. . . and containing. . . dear me. . . \"\n\"An 'air from ze 'ead of a veela,\" said Fleur. \"One of my grandmuzzer's. \"\nSo Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron. . . then he remembered that Ron wasn't speaking to him. \"Yes,\" said Mr. Ollivander, \"yes, I've never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands. . . however, to each his own, and if this suits you. . \"\nMr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or\nbumps; then he muttered, \"Orchideous! \" and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip. \"Very well, very well, it's in fine working order,\" said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. \"Mr. Diggory, you next. \"\nFleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her. \"Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn't it? \" said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. \"Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn. . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches. . . ash. . . pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition. . . You treat it regularly? \"\n\"Polished it last night,\" said Cedric, grinning. Harry hooked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted. Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric's wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, \"Mr. Krum, if you please. \"\nViktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes. \"Hmm,\" said Mr. Olhivander, \"this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I'm much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling is never quite what I. . . however. . \"\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes. \"Yes. . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring? \" he shot at Krum, who nodded. \"Rather thicker than one usually sees. . . quite rigid. . . ten and a quarter inches. . . Avis! \"\nThe hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight. \"Good,\" said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. \"Which leaves. . . Mr. Potter. \"\nHarry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over his wand. \"Aaaah, yes,\" said Mr. Ohlivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. \"Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember. \"\nHarry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday. . . . Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander's shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him - this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. \"Curious,\" he had said, \"curious,\" and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort's. Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did. Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry's wand than anyone else's. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition. \"Thank you all,\" said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. \"You may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end -\"\nFeeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat. \"Photos, Dumbledore, photos! \" cried Bagman excitedly. \"All the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita? \"\n\"Er - yes, let's do those first,\" said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. \"And then perhaps some individual shots. \"\nThe photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of\nthe group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go. Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn't there - he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron. \"You've had an owl,\" said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry's pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there. \"Oh - right,\" said Harry. \"And we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape's dungeon,\" said Ron. He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of Sirius's answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it. Harry - I can't say everything I would like to in a letter, it's too risky in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face-to-face. Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o'clock in the morning on the 22nd ofNovember? I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you're around Dumbledore and Moody I don't think anyone will be able to hurt you. However, someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under Dumbkdore's nose. Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let me know about the 22nd ofNovember as quickly as you can. Sirius CHAPTER NINETEEN - THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL\nThe prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task. Admittedly, he didn't see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested; and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that - Filch would skin them alive. In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn't been mentioned at all. The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard. I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I'm not ashamed to admit it. . . . I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they're watching over me. . . But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his \"er's\" into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too. Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in the school. From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people --Slytherins, mainly -- quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments. \"Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration? \"\n\"Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together? \"\n\"Hey - Harry! \"\n\"Yeah, that's right! \" Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough. \"I've just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I'm just off to do a bit more. . . \"No - it was just - you dropped your quill."

                "text": "So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter. \"\n\"But-I don't-\"\n\"You heard me, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way. A week ago. Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he'd rather have another round with the dragon. Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball - or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night. . . . \"Why do they have to move in packs? \" Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \"How're you supposed to get one on their own to ask them? \"\n\"Lasso one? \" Ron suggested. \"Got any idea who you're going to try? \"\nHarry didn't answer. He knew perfectly well whom he'd like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular. Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry's head. \"Listen, you're not going to have any trouble. You're a champion. You've just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they'll be queuing up to go with you. \"\nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry's amazement, he turned out to be quite right. A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused. \"She was quite good-looking,\" said Ron fairly, after he'd stopped laughing. \"She was a foot taller than me,\" said Harry, still unnerved. \"Imagine what I'd look like trying to dance with her. \"\nHermione's words about Krum kept coming back to him. \"They only like him because he's famous! \" Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn't been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him. On the whole. Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric - he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry's tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it - and just to heighten Harry's feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet. \"She didn' seem very int'rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,\" Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts. \"She jus' wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,\" Hagrid continued in a low voice. \"Well, I told her we'd been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. 'Never had to tell him off in four years? ' she said. 'Never played you up in lessons, has he? ' I told her no, an she didn' seem happy at all. Yeh'd think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry. \"\n\" 'Course she did,\" said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. \"She can't keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it'll get boring. \"\n\"She wants a new angle, Hagrid,\" said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs. \"You were supposed to say Harry's a mad delinquent! \"\n\"But he's not! \" said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked. \"She should've interviewed Snape,\" said Harry grimly. \"He'd give her the goods on me any day. 'Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . . '\"\n\"Said that, did he? \" said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. \"Well, yeh might've bent a few rules. Harry, bu' yeh're all righ' really, aren' you? \"\n\"Cheers, Hagrid,\" said Harry, grinning. \"You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid? \" said Ron. \"Though' I might look in on it, yeah,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Should be a good do, I reckon. You'll be openin the dancin', won yeh, Harry? Who're you takin'? \"\n\"No one, yet,\" said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn't pursue the subject. The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of them - for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up\nlistening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group. Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions - as Binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percys cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term. \"Evil, he is,\" Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. \"Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying. \"\n\"Mmm . . . you're not exactly straining yourself, though, are you? \" said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack - a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second. \"It's Christmas, Hermione,\" said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire. Hermione looked severely over at him too. \"I'd have thought you'd be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don't want to learn your antidotes! \"\n\"Like what? \" Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser. \"That egg! \" Hermione hissed. \"Come on, Hermione, I've got till February the twenty-fourth,\" Harry said. He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn't opened it since the celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all. \"But it might take weeks to work it out! \" said Hermione. \"You're going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don't! \"\n\"Leave him alone, Hermione, he's earned a bit of a break,\" said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows. \"Nice look, Ron . . . go well with your dress robes, that will. \"\nIt was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done. \"Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon? \" George asked. \"No, he's off delivering a letter,\" said Ron. \"Why? \"\n\"Because George wants to invite him to the ball,\" said Fred sarcastically. \"Because we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,\" said George. \"Who d'you two keep writing to, eh? \" said Ron. \"Nose out, Ron, or I'll burn that for you too,\" said Fred, waving his wand threateningly. \"So . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet? \"\n\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Well, you'd better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,\" said Fred. \"Who're you going with, then? \" said Ron. \"Angelina,\" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment. \"What? \" said Ron, taken aback. \"You've already asked her? \"\n\"Good point,\" said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, \"Oi! Angelina! \"\nAngelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him. \"What? \" she called back. \"Want to come to the ball with me? \"\nAngelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look. \"All right, then,\" she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face. \"There you go,\" said Fred to Harry and Ron, \"piece of cake. \"\nHe got to his feet, yawning, and said, \"We'd better use a school owl then, George, come\non. . . . \"\nThey left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry. \"We should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He's right. We don't want to end up with a pair of trolls. \"\nHermione let out a sputter of indignation. \"A pair of. . . what, excuse me? \"\n\"Well - you know,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"I'd rather go alone than with - with Eloise Midgen, say. \"\n\"Her acne's loads better lately - and she's really nice! \"\n\"Her nose is off-center,\" said Ron. \"Oh I see,\" Hermione said, bristling. \"So basically, you're going to take the best-looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible? \"\n\"Er - yeah, that sounds about right,\" said Ron. \"I'm going to bed,\" Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls' staircase without another word. The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up. Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear \"0 Come, All Ye Faithful\" sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude. And still. Harry hadn't asked Cho to the ball."

Moody was still gazing at the map. \"Potter . . . \" he said slowly, \"you didn't happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snapes office, did you? On this map, I mean? \"\n\"Er . . . yeah, I did . . . \" Harry admitted. \"It was Mr. Crouch. \"\nMoodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked suddenly alarmed. \"Crouch? \" he said. \"You're - you're sure. Potter? \"\n\"Positive,\" said Harry. \"Well, he's not here anymore,\" said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. \"Crouch . . . that's very - very interesting. . . . \"\nHe said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that\nthis news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly. . . yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . . \"Er . . . Professor Moody . . . why d'you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snapes office? \"\nMoodys magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him. \"Put it this way. Potter,\" Moody muttered finally, \"they say old Mad-Eye's obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I'm nothing - nothing - compared to Barty Crouch. \"\nHe continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more. \"Professor Moody? \" he said again. \"D'you think. . . could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there's something going on. . . . \"\n\"Like what? \" said Moody sharply. Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn't want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius. \"I don't know,\" Harry muttered, \"odd stuffs been happening lately, hasn't it? It's been in the Daily Prophet. . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . . \"\nBoth of Moody's mismatched eyes widened. \"You're a sharp boy. Potter,\" he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder's Map. \"Crouch could be thinking along those lines,\" he said slowly. \"Very possible. . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately - helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It's making a lot of people nervous, I reckon. \" A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. \"Oh if there's one thing I hate,\" he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, \"its a Death Eater who walked free. . . . \"\nHarry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant? \"And now I want to ask you a question. Potter,\" said Moody in a more businesslike tone. Harrys heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object - and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself-\"\nCan I borrow this? \"\n\"Oh! \" said Harry. He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn't asking where he'd got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor. \"Yeah, okay. \"\n\"Good boy,\" growled Moody. \"I can make good use of this . . . this might be exactly what I've been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. . . . \"\nThey climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody's office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry. \"You ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry, taken aback. \"You want to consider it,\" said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully. \"Yes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I'm guessing you werent Just taking that egg for a walk tonight? \"\n\"Er - no,\" said Harry, grinning. \"I've been working out the clue. \"\nMoody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again. \"Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See you in the morning. . . . \"\nHe went back into his office, staring down at the Marauders Map again, and closed the door behind him. Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office? And Moody thought he. Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea. . . but somehow. Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career. CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX - THE SECOND TASK\nYou said you'd already worked out that egg clue! \" said Hermione indignantly. \"Keep your voice down! \" said Harry crossly. \"I just need to - sort of fine-tune it, all right? \"\nHe, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today - the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room - Professor Flitwick, for instance. \"Just forget the egg for a minute, all right? \" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. \"I'm trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. . . . \"\nThis class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour. \"Snape said Moodys searched his office as well? \" Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati's hat off). \"What. . . d'you reckon Moody's here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff? \"\n\"Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely doing it,\"\nsaid Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. \"Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he's giving him a second chance or something. . . . \"\n\"What? \" said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick's desk. \"Harry. . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire! \"\n\"Oh Ron,\" said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, \"we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry's life, remember? \"\nShe Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking. . . it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he'd loathed Harry s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school. \"I don't care what Moody says,\" Hermione went on. \"Dumbledore's not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn't have given them jobs, so why shouldn't he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit -\"\n\"- evil,\" said Ron promptly. \"Come on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then? \"\n\"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill? \" said Hermione, ignoring Ron. \"Its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to? \"\n\"You just don't like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,\" said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window. \"You just want to think Snapes up to something,\" said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box. \"I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he's on his second one,\"\nsaid Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione's. Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape s office, and Moody and Snape's conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February. Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again - Harry had explained about\nAqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy - it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts. \"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,\" Hermione said. \"If only we'd done human Transfiguration already! But I don't think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing. . . . \"\n\"Yeah, I don't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,\" said Harry. \"I s'pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me. . . . \"\n\"I don't think he'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,\" said Hermione seriously. \"No, I think your best chance is some sort of charm. \"\nSo Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends - though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian. Madam Pince, for help - they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale. Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon. Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound to find something soon) . . . three days to go (please let me find something. . . please). . . With two days left. Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him. Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl. Harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank. \"Weekend after next,\" whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harrys shoulder. \"Here - take my quill and send this owl back straight away."

Tryin' ter get back in me good books, tryin' ter get me ter tell her what's comin in the third task. Ha! You can' trust any of'em! \"\nHagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened. CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE - THE DREAM\nIt comes down to this,\" said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. \"Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn't looking. \"\n\"It must've been Crouch,\" said Ron at once. \"That's why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He'd done a runner. \"\n\"I don't think so,\" said Harry, shaking his head. \"He seemed really weak - I don't reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything. \"\n\"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven't I told you enough times? \" said Hermione. \"Okay. . . hows this for a theory,\" said Ron excitedly. \"Krum attacked Crouch - no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself! \"\n\"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he? \" said Hermione coldly. \"Oh yeah . . . \"\nIt was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch. \"Just go through it again, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"What did Mr. Crouch actually say? \"\n\"I've told you, he wasn't making much sense,\" said Harry. \"He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son. \"\n\"Well, that was his fault,\" said Hermione testily. \"He was out of his mind,\" said Harry. \"Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions. \"\n\"And . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who? \" said Ron tentatively. \"I've told you,\" Harry repeated dully. \"He said he's getting stronger. \"\nThere was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \"But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . . \"\n\"He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\" said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \"He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore. \"\nHarry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night's hunting with a mouse in its beak. \"If Snape hadn't held me up,\" Harry said bitterly, \"we might've got there in time. 'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter? ' Why couldn't he have just got out of the way? \"\n\"Maybe he didn't want you to get there! \" said Ron quickly. \"Maybe - hang on - how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest? D'you reckon he could've beaten you and Dumbledore there? \"\n\"Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\" said Harry. \"Wouldn't put it past him,\" Ron muttered. \"We need to see Professor Moody,\" said Hermione. \"We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch,\"\n\"If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy,\" said Harry. \"Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\" said Ron, \"because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -\"\n\"Shh! \" said Hermione suddenly. Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer. \"- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-\"\n\"- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn't like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -\"\n\"I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail! \"\n\"Yeah, and you won't be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you? \"\nThe Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"What're you doing here? \" Ron and Fred said at the same time. \"Sending a letter,\" said Harry and George in unison. \"What, at this time? \" said Hermione and Fred. Fred grinned. \"Fine - we won't ask you what you're doing, if you don't ask us,\" he said. He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered. \"Well, don't let us hold you up,\" Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door. Ron didn't move. \"Who're you blackmailing? \" he said. The grin vanished from Fred's face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron. \"Don't be stupid, I was only joking,\" he said easily. \"Didn't sound like that,\" said Ron. Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \"I've told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can't see why you would, but -\"\n\"It's my business if you're blackmailing someone,\" said Ron. \"George's right, you could end up in serious trouble for that. \"\n\"Told you, I was joking,\" said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \"You're starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you'll be made a prefect. \"\n\"No, I won't! \" said Ron hotly. George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron. \"Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later. \"\nHe and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another. \"You don't think they know something about all this, do you? \" Hermione whispered. \"About Crouch and everything? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"If it was something that serious, they'd tell someone. They'd tell Dumbledore. \"\nRon, however, was looking uncomfortable. \"What's the matter? \" Hermione asked him. \"Well. . . \" said Ron slowly, \"I dunno if they would. They're . . . they're obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them - when - you know -\"\n\"We weren't talking. \" Harry finished the sentence for him. \"Yeah, but blackmail. . . \"\n\"It's this joke shop idea they've got,\" said Ron. \"I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They've only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it's time to think about their future, and Dad can't help them, and they need gold to get started. \"\nHermione was looking uncomfortable now. \"Yes, but. . . they wouldn't do anything against the law to get gold. \"\n\"Wouldn't they? \" said Ron, looking skeptical. \"I dunno . . . they don't exactly mind breaking rules, do they? \"\n\"Yes, but this is the law\" said Hermione, looking scared. \"This isn't some silly school rule. . . . They'll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron. . . maybe you'd\nbetter tell Percy. . . . \"\n\"Are you mad? \" said Ron. \"Tell Percy? He'd probably do a Crouch and turn them in. \" He stared at the window through which Fred and George's owl had departed, then said, \"Come on, let's get some breakfast. \"\n\"D'you think it's too early to go and see Professor Moody? \" Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"He'd probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he'll think we're trying to attack him while he's asleep. Let's give it till break. \"\nHistory of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron's watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron's was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn't taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus. When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual. \"Professor Moody? \" Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd. \"Hello, Potter,\" growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody's head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again. \"Come in here. \"\nHe stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door. \"Did you find him? \" Harry asked without preamble. \"Mr. Crouch? \"\n\"No,\" said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask. \"Did you use the map? \" Harry said. \"Of course,\" said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \"Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn't anywhere on there. \"\n\"So he did Disapparate? \" said Ron. \"You can't Disapparate on the grounds, Ron! \" said Hermione. \"There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren't there, Professor? \"\nMoody's magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \"You're another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\" he told her. \"Mind works the right way. Granger. \"\nHermione flushed pink with pleasure. \"Well, he wasn't invisible,\" said Harry. \"The map shows invisible people. He must've left the grounds, then. \"\n\"But under his own steam? \" said Hermione eagerly, \"or because someone made him? \"\n\"Yeah, someone could've - could've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn't they? \" said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror. \"We can't rule out kidnap,\" growled Moody. \"So,\" said Ron, \"d'you reckon he's somewhere in Hogsmeade? \"\n\"Could be anywhere,\" said Moody, shaking his head. \"Only thing we know for sure is that he's not here. \"\nHe yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \"Now, Dumbledore's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there's nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry'll be looking for him now, Dumbledore's notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task. \"\n\"What? \" said Harry. \"Oh yeah . . . \"\nHe hadn't given the maze a single thought since he'd left it with Krum the previous night. \"Should be right up your street, this one,\" said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \"From what Dumbledore's said, you've managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerers Stone in your first year, didn't you? \"\n\"We helped,\" Ron said quickly. \"Me and Hermione helped. \"\nMoody grinned. \"Well, help him practice for this one, and I'll be very surprised if he doesn't win,\"\nsaid Moody. \"In the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance. \" He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it. \"You two,\" counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \"you stick close to Potter, all right? I'm keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out. \"\nSirius sent their owl back the very next morning."

My true family returns. . . . \"\nThe air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robes. Master . . . Master \" he murmured. The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered. \"Welcome, Death Eaters,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"Thirteen years. . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday, we are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we? \"\nHe put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening. \"I smell guilt,\" he said. \"There is a stench or guilt upon the air. A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare to step back from him. \"I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact - such prompt appearances! and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty? \"\nNo one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm. \"And I answer myself,\" whispered Voldemort, \"they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . . \"And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living? \"And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort. . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore? \"\nAt the mention of Dumbledore's name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them. \"It is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . . \"\nOne of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort's feet. \"Master! \" he shrieked, \"Master, forgive me! Forgive us all! \"\nVoldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand. \"Crucio! \"\nThe Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything. . . Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. \"Get up, Avery,\" said Voldemort softly. \"Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years' repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail? \"\nHe looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob. \"You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don't you? \"\n\"Yes, Master,\" moaned Wormtail, \"please. Master . . . please . . . \"\n\"Yet you helped return me to my body,\" said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \"Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . . \"\nVoldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand's wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtails bleeding wrist. Wormtail's sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder. \"My Lord,\" he whispered. \"Master . . . it is beautiful. . . thank you. . . thank you. . . . \"\nHe scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort's robes. \"May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\" said Voldemort. \"No, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . . \"\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail's right. \"Lucius, my slippery friend,\" he whispered, halting before him. \"I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay. . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master? \"\n\"My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\" came Lucius Malfoy's voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \"Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me -\"\n\"And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer? \" said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \"Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future. \"\n\"Of course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . . \"\nVoldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space - large enough for two people -that separated Malfoy and the next man. \"The Lestranges should stand here,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"But they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . . \"\nHe walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them. \"Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . . \"\n\"Thank you, Master . . . thank you,\" murmured Macnair. \"And here\" - Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures - \"we have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle? \"\nThey bowed clumsily, muttering dully. \"Yes, Master . . . \"\n\"We will, Master. . . . \"\n\"The same goes for you, Nott,\" said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure\nin Mr. Goyles shadow. \"My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful -\"\n\"That will do,\" said Voldemort. He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there. \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service. \"\nThe Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks. \"He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . . \"Yes,\" said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry's direction. \"Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor. \"\nThere was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy's voice spoke from under the mask. \"Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . . \"\n\"Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,\" said Voldemort. \"And it begins - and ends - with my young friend here. \"\nHe walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle. \"You know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall? \" Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \"You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him - and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy. \"\nVoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry's cheek. \"His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it. . . but no matter. I can touch him now. \"\nHarry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters. \"I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman's foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost. . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know. . . I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal - to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself. . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . . \"I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me. . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . , but I waited in vain. . . . \"\nThe shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing. \"Only one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals - snakes, of course, being my preference - but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . . \"Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard -young, foolish, and gullible - wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of. . . for he was a teacher at\nDumbledore's school. . . he was easy to bend to my will. . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed."

                "text": "\"But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father's Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn't know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden. \"\n\"Master Barty, you bad boy! \" whispered Winky, tears trickling between her fingers. \"So you took the wand,\" said Dumbledore, \"and what did you do with it? \"\n\"We went back to the tent,\" said Crouch. \"Then we heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky. \"Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both Stunned. \"When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape. \"\nWinky let out a wail of despair. \"Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . . \"\nCrouch's head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. \"My master came for me. \"He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant - perhaps the most faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the door. \"\nThe smile spread wider over Crouch's face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky's petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers. She seemed too\nappalled to speak. \"It was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn't been in years. \"And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do? \" said Dumbledore. \"He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first -\"\n\"You needed Alastor Moody,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm. \"Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody's double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody's clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it. \"\n\"And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody? \" said Dumbledore. \"Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father's house, and to keep watch over my father. \"\n\"But your father escaped,\" said Dumbledore. \"Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban. \"My master sent me word of my father's escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything. \"\n\"Map? \" said Dumbledore quickly. \"What map is this? \"\n\"Potter's map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape's office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape. \"For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father. \"\n\"Noooo! \" wailed Winky. \"Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying? \"\n\"You killed your father,\" Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. \"What did you do with the body? \"\n\"Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come. \"Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father's body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father's body. He became a\nbone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid's cabin. \"\nThere was complete silence now, except for Winky's continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, \"And tonight. . . \"\n\"I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,\" whispered Barty Crouch. \"Turned it into a Portkey. My master's plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards. \"\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side. CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX - THE PARTING OF THE WAYS\nDumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall. \"Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs? \"\n\"Of course,\" said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady. \"Severus\" - Dumbledore turned to Snape - \"please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour's time if he needs me. \"\nSnape nodded silently and swept out of the room. \"Harry? \" Dumbledore said gently. Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor. \"I want you to come up to my office first. Harry,\" he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway. \"Sirius is waiting for us there. \"\nHarry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn't want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn't want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric. . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents. . . . \"Professor,\" Harry mumbled, \"where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory? \"\n\"They are with Professor Sprout,\" said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. \"She was Head of Cedric's house, and knew him best. \"\nThey had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had crossed the room. \"Harry, are you all right? I knew it - I knew something like this - what happened? \"\nHis hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk. \"What happened? \" he asked more urgently. Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn't have to think or feel anymore. There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry's knee. \"'Lo, Fawkes,\" said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix's beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight. Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything. \"I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze. Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"We can leave that till morning, can't we, Dumbledore? \" said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harrys shoulder. \"Let him have a sleep. Let him rest."

Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle. \"That's never - you're kidding -\" Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes. \"No, I'm not,\" said Hermione, beaming. \"I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you'll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears. \"\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something. \"There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum! \"\n\"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we'd had our conversation by the lake. And unless I'm very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She's been buzzing around for stories all year. \"\n\"When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . . \" said Ron slowly. \"He was talking to her, in his hand,\" said Hermione. \"He knew, of course. That's how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff\nabout us and Hagrid. \"\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass. \"I've told her I'll let her out when we get back to London,\" said Hermione. \"I've put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can't transform. And I've told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can't break the habit of writing horrible lies about people. \"\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag. The door of the compartment slid open. \"Very clever. Granger,\" said Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them. \"So,\" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \"You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal. \"\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered. \"Trying not to think about it, are we? \" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \"Trying to pretend it hasn't happened? \"\n\"Get out,\" said Harry. He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes. \"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this! \" He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. \"Too late now. Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well - second - Diggory was the f-\"\nIt was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the floor. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so. \"Thought we'd see what those three were up to,\" said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside. \"Interesting effect,\" said George, looking down at Crabbe. \"Who used the Furnunculus Curse? \"\n\"Me,\" said Harry. \"Odd,\" said George lightly. \"I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn't be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor. \"\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle - each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit - out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut. \"Exploding Snap, anyone? \" said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards. They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them. \"You going to tell us, then? \" he said to George. \"Who you were blackmailing? \"\n\"Oh,\" said George darkly. \"That. \"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. \"It wasn't anything important. Not now, anyway. \"\n\"We've given up,\" said George, shrugging. But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, \"All right, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo Bagman. \"\n\"Bagman? \" said Harry sharply. \"Are you saying he was involved in -\"\n\"Nah,\" said George gloomily. \"Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn't have the brains. \"\n\"Well, what, then? \" said Ron. Fred hesitated, then said, \"You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch? \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry and Ron slowly. \"Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the Irish mascots. \"\n\"So? \"\n\"So,\" said Fred impatiently, \"it vanished, didn't it? By next morning, it had gone! \"\n\"But - it must've been an accident, mustn't it? \" said Hermione. George laughed very bitterly. \"Yeah, that's what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us. \"\n\"In the end, he turned pretty nasty,\" said Fred. \"Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn't giving us anything. \"\n\"So we asked for our money back,\" said George glowering. \"He didn't refuse! \" gasped Hermione. \"Right in one,\" said Fred. \"But that was all your savings! \" said Ron. \"Tell me about it,\" said George. \"'Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost everything gambling. Hasn't got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back? \"\n\"How? \" said Harry. \"He put a bet on you, mate,\" said Fred. \"Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins. \"\n\"So that's why he kept trying to help me win! \" said Harry. \"Well - I did win, didn't I? So he can pay you your gold! \"\n\"Nope,\" said George, shaking his head. \"The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task. \"\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again. The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King's Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put. \"Fred - George - wait a moment. \"\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings. \"Take it,\" he said, and he thrust the sack into George's hands. \"What? \" said Fred, looking flabbergasted. \"Take it,\" Harry repeated firmly. \"I don't want it. \"\n\"You're mental,\" said George, trying to push it back at Harry. \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry. \"You take it, and get inventing. It's for the joke shop. \"\n\"He is mental,\" Fred said in an almost awed voice. \"Listen,\" said Harry firmly. \"If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long. \"\n\"Harry,\" said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \"there's got to be a thousand Galleons in here. \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Think how many Canary Creams that is. \"\nThe twins stared at him. \"Just don't tell your mum where you got it. . . although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . . \"\n\"Harry,\" Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand. \"Look,\" he said flatly, \"take it, or I'll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they're from you. \"\nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe,\nand Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks. Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, \"I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry. \"\n\"See you. Harry,\" said Ron, clapping him on the back. \"'Bye, Harry! \" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek. \"Harry - thanks,\" George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side. Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys' car. As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he would have to meet it when it did. 5.

                "text": "Though he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry's impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed it - they all thought Mr Crouch had gone mad). 'Yeah, we were all surprised,' said George, 'because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realised Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn't going to complain. '\n    'So how come they promoted him? '\n    That's exactly what we wondered,' said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. 'He came home really pleased with himself - 'even more pleased than usual, if you can imagine that - and told Dad he'd been offered a position in Fudge's own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts: Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think. '\n    'Only Dad wasn't,' said Fred grimly. 'Why not? ' said Harry. 'Well, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody's having any contact with Dumbledore,' said George. 'Dumbledore's name is mud with the Ministry these days, see,' said Fred. They all think he's just making trouble saying You-Know-Who's back. '\n    'Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who's in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,' said George. Trouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he's friendly with Dumbledore, and he's always thought Dad's a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession. '\n    'But what's that got to do with Percy? ' asked Harry, confused. 'I'm coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family - and Dumbledore. '\n    Harry let out a low whistle. 'Bet Percy loved that. '\n    Ron laughed in a hollow sort of way. 'He went completely berserk. He said - well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he's been having to struggle against Dad's lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad's got no ambition and that's why we've always been - you know - 'not had a lot of money, I mean - '\n    'What? ' said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat. 'I know,' said Ron in a low voice. 'And it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he - Percy - knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn't belong to our family any more. And he packed his bags the same night and left. He's living here in London now. '\n    Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ron's brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr Weasley. 'Mums been in a right state,' said Ron dully. 'You know - crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work - ignores him, I s'pose. '\n    'But Percy must know Voldemort's back,' said Harry slowly. 'He's not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn't risk everything without proof. '\n    'Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,' said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. 'Percy said the only evidence was your word and . . . I dunno . . . he didn't think it was good enough. '\n    'Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,' said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded. 'What are you talking about? ' Harry asked, looking around at them all. They were all regarding him warily. 'Haven't - haven't you been getting the Daily Prophet? ' Hermione asked nervously. 'Yeah, I have! ' said Harry. 'Have you - er - been reading it thoroughly? ' Hermione asked, still more anxiously. 'Not cover to cover,' said Harry defensively. 'If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn't it? '\n    The others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, 'Well, you'd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they - um - they mention you a couple of times a week. '\n    'But I'd have seen - '\n    'Not if you've only been reading the front page, you wouldn't,' said Hermione, shaking her head. 'I'm not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you're a standing joke. '\n    'What d'you - ? '\n    'It's quite nasty, actually,' said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. They're just building on Rita's stuff. '\n    'But she's not writing for them any more, is she? '\n    'Oh, no, she's kept her promise - not that she's got any choice,' Hermione added with satisfaction. 'But she laid the foundation for what they're trying to do now. '\n    'Which is what? ' said Harry impatiently. 'OK, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that? '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter's stories about him in a hurry. 'Well, they're writing about you as though you're this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he's a great tragic hero or something,' said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. 'They keep slipping in snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears, they say something like, \"A tale worthy of Harry Potter\", and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it's, \"Let's hope he hasn't got a scar on his forehead or we'll be asked to worship him next\" - '\n    'I don't want anyone to worship - ' Harry began hotly. 'I know you don't,' said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. 'I know, Harry. But you see what they're doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I'll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you're just some stupid boy who's a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going. '\n    'I didn't ask - I didn't want - Voldemort killed my parents! ' Harry spluttered. 'I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn't kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don't I hey think I'd rather it'd never- '\n    'We know, Harry' said Ginny earnestly. 'And of course, they didn't report a word about the Dementors attacking you,' said Hermione. 'Someone's told them to keep that quiet. That should've been a really big story, out-of-control Dementors. They haven't even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy. We thought they would, it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off. We think they're biding their time until you're expelled, then they're really going to go to town - I mean, if you're expelled, obviously,' she went on hastily. 'You really shouldn't be, not if they abide by their own laws, there's no case against you. '\n    They were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about that. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. 'Uh oh. '\n    Fred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway. The meetings over, you can come down and have dinner now. Everyone's dying to see you, Harry. And who's left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door? '\n    'Crookshanks,' said Ginny unblushingly. 'He loves playing with them. '\n    'Oh,' said Mrs Weasley, 'I thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don't forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please. '\n    Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione. Both of them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed. 'Look . . . ' he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, 'We knew you'd be angry, Harry, we really don't blame you, but you've got to understand, we did try to persuade Dumbledore -\n    'Yeah, I know,' said Harry shortly. He cast around for a topic that didn't involve his headmaster, because the very thought of Dumbledore made Harry's insides burn with anger again. Who's Kreacher? ' he asked. The house-elf who lives here,' said Ron. 'Nutter. Never met one like him. '\n    Hermione frowned at Ron. 'He's not a nutter, Ron. '\n    'His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother,' said Ron irritably. 'Is that normal, Hermione? '\n    'Well - well, if he is a bit strange, it's not his fault. '\n    Ron rolled his eyes at Harry. 'Hermione still hasn't given up on SPEW. '\n    'It's not SPEW! ' said Hermione heatedly. 'It's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. And it's not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too. '\n    'Yeah, yeah,' said Ron. 'C'mon, I'm starving. '\n    He led the way out of the door and on to the landing, but be ore they could descend the stairs - '\n    'Hold it! ' Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any further. They're still in the hall, we might be able to hear something. '\n    The three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry's guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very centre of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leant further over the banisters. He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix . . . A thin piece of flesh-coloured string descended in front of Harry's eyes. Looking up, he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear towards the dark knot of people below. A moment later, however, they all began to move towards the front door and out of sight. 'Dammit,' Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again. They heard the front door open, then close. 'Snape never eats here,' Ron told Harry quietly. Thank Clod. C'mon. '\n    'And don't forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,' Hermione whispered. As they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall, they saw Lupin, Mrs Weasley and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left. 'We're eating down in the kitchen,' Mrs Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. 'Harry, dear, if you'll just tiptoe across the hall it's through this door here - '\n    CRASH. 'Tonks! ' cried Mrs Weasley in exasperation, turning to look behind her. 'I'm sorry! ' wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. 'It's that stupid umbrella stand, that's the second time I've tripped over - '\n    But the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, ear-splitting, blood-curdling screech. The moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured - then he realised it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life."

                "text": "There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it - '\n    'Enough, enough! ' said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face. 'I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story - '\n    Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. 'We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,' he said, 'other than Dudley Dursley, I mean. '\n    Fudges plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, 'We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly - '\n    'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones? ' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle. 'True,' said Madam Bones. 'Perfectly true. '\n    'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge. 'Where is this person? '\n    'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore. 'She's just outside the door. Should I - ? '\n    'No - Weasley, you go,' Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them. A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers. Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself. 'Full name? ' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat. 'Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice. 'And who exactly are you? ' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice\n    'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg. 'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events. '\n    'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs Figg. 'So you wouldn't have me registered, would you? '\n    'A Squib, eh? ' said Fudge, eyeing her closely. 'We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors? ' he added, looking left and right along the bench. \"Yes, we can! ' said Mrs Figg indignantly. Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. 'Very well,' he said aloofly. 'What is your story? '\n    'I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,' gabbled Mrs Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, 'when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running - '\n    'Running? ' said Madam Bones sharply. 'Dementors don't run, they glide. '\n    'That's what I meant to say,' said Mrs Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. 'Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys. '\n    'What did they look like? ' said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh. 'Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny - '\n    'No, no,' said Madam Bones impatiently. 'The Dementors . . . describe them. '\n    'Oh,' said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. They were big. Big and wearing cloaks. Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded. 'Big and wearing cloaks,' repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. 'I see. Anything else? '\n    'Yes,' said Mrs Figg. 'I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . . '\n    Her voice shook and died. Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it. 'What did the Dementors do? ' she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope. They went for the boys,' said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. 'One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that . . . that is what happened,' Mrs Figg finished, somewhat lamely. Madam Bones looked down at Mrs Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, That's what you saw, is it? '\n    That is what happened,' Mrs Figg repeated. 'Very well,' said Fudge. 'You may go. '\n    Mrs Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her. 'Not a very convincing witness,' said Fudge loftily. 'Oh, I don't know,' said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. 'She certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't. '\n    'But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard? ' snorted Fudge. The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn't have bet - '\n    'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly. The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shade w, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent. 'And what is that supposed to mean? ' Fudge asked icily. 'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore. 'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging! ' barked Fudge. 'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius. '\n    'Yes, you have,' said Fudge forcefully, 'and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The Dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to. '\n    Then,' said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, 'we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August. '\n    In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time. He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue. The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,' said Fudge. The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. 'I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,' she said, with a simper that felt her big, round eyes as cold as ever. 'So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy! '\n    She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused. 'If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,' said Dumbledore politely. 'Of course, these particular Dementors may have been outside Ministry control - '\n    'There are no Dementors outside Ministry control! snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red. Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. 'Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation. '\n    'It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore! ' snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud. 'Of course it isn't,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated. '\n    He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly. 'I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these Dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing! ' said Fudge. 'We are here to examine Harry Potter's offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery! '\n    'Of course we are,' said Dumbledore, 'but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch him- or herself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time of the - '\n    'We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much! ' snarled Fudge. 'Of course you are,' said Dumbledore courteously. Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes? '\n    'If there were Dementors, which I doubt. '\n    'You have heard it from an eyewitness,' Dumbledore interrupted. 'If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object. '\n    'I - that - not -' blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. 'It's - I want this over with today, Dumbledore! '\n    'But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,' said Dumbledore. 'Serious miscarriage, my hat! ' said Fudge at the top of his voice.

I suppose you've forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago - '\n    'That wasn't me, it was a house-elf! ' said Harry. 'YOU SEE? ' roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction. 'A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you. '\n    The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,' said Dumbledore. 'I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish. '\n    'I - not - I haven't got time to listen to house-elves!"

'\n    'Well, what does that mean? ' said Ron impatiently. 'I'll tell you what it means,' said Hermione through gritted teeth. 'It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. '\n    There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking flustered. 'Ron, we're supposed to show the first-years where to go! '\n    'Oh yeah,' said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. 'Hey - hey, you lot! Midgets! '\n    'Ron! '\n    'Well, they are, they're titchy . . . '\n    'I know, but you can't call them midgets! - First-years! ' Hermione called commandingly along the table. 'This way, please! '\n    A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified; he nudged Euan and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap. 'See you later,' he said dully to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the Entrance Hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind. He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone was staring at him; he had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been time last term to explain himself before they'd all had to go home - even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard. Harry had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realised that he did not know the new password. 'Er . . . ' he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him. 'No password, no entrance,' she said loftily. 'Harry, I know it! ' Someone panted up behind him and he turned to see Neville jogging towards him. 'Guess what it is? I'm actually going to be able to remember it for once - ' He waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train. 'Mimbuius mimbletonia! '\n    'Correct,' said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open towards them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed. The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard. Harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys' dormitories; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid. 'Hi,' he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it. 'Hey, Harry,' said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the West Ham colours. 'Good holiday? '\n    'Not bad,' muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. 'You? '\n    'Yeah, it was OK,' chuckled Dean. 'Better than Seamus's, anyway, he was just telling me. '\n    'Why, what happened, Seamus? ' Neville asked as he placed his Mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet. Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, 'Me mam didn't want me to come back. '\n    'What? ' said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes. 'She didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts. '\n    Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry. 'But - why? ' said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus's mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursleyish. Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas. 'Well,' he said in a measured voice, I suppose . . . because of you. '\n    What d'you mean? ' said Harry quickly. His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him. Well,' said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry's eye, she . . . er . . . well, it's not just you, it's Dumbledore, too . . . '\n    'She believes the Daily Prophet? ' said Harry. 'She thinks I'm a liar and Dumbledore's an old fool? '\n    Seamus looked up at him. 'Yeah, something like that. '\n    Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down on to his bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas. He was sick of it: sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to . . . Mrs Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely. He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, 'Look . . . what did happen that night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all? '\n    Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard. 'What are you asking me for? ' Harry retorted. 'Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don't you? That'll tell you all you need to know. '\n    'Don't you have a go at my mother,' Seamus snapped. 'I'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,' said Harry. 'Don't talk to me like that! '\n    'I'll talk to you how I want,' said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table. 'If you've got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved . . . stop your mummy worrying - '\n    'Leave my mother out of this, Potter! '\n    'What's going on? '\n    Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes travelled from Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised. 'He's having a go at my mother! ' Seamus yelled. What? ' said Ron. 'Harry wouldn't do that - we met your mother, we liked her . . . '\n    'That's before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me! ' said Harry at the top of his voice. 'Oh,' said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. 'Oh . . . right. '\n    'You know what? ' said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look. 'He's right, I don't want to share a dormitory with him any more, he's mad. '\n    'That's out of order, Seamus,' said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red - always a danger sign. 'Out of order, am I? ' shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was going pale. 'You believe all the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he's telling the truth? '\n    'Yeah, I do! ' said Ron angrily. 'Then you're mad, too,' said Seamus in disgust. 'Yeah? Well, unfortunately for you, pal, I'm also a prefect! ' said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. 'So unless you want detention, watch your mouth! '\n    Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville. 'Anyone else's parents got a problem with Harry? ' he said aggressively. 'My parents are Muggles, mate,' said Dean, shrugging. They don't know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I'm not stupid enough to tell them. '\n    'You don't know my mother, she'd weasel anything out of anyone! ' Seamus snapped at him. 'Anyway, your parents don't get the Daily Prophet. They don't know our Headmaster's been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he's losing his marbles - '\n    'My gran says that's rubbish,' piped up Neville. 'She says it's the Daily Prophet that's going downhill, not Dumbledore. She's cancelled our subscription. We believe Harry,' said Neville simply. He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus. 'My grans always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She says if Dumbledore says he's back, he's back. '\n    Harry felt a rush of gratitude towards Neville. Nobody else said anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over and fell silent. Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus. Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his things away. He fell, shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying, or unhinged? Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community. Anyone who thought\n    Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was, too, or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked . . . They'll know we're right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he wondered how many more attacks like Seamus's he would have to endure before that time came. - CHAPTER TWELVE -\nProfessor Umbridge\nSeamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry had even put on his socks. 'Does he think he'll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long? ' asked Harry loudly as the hem of Seamus's robes wnipped out of sight. 'Don't worry about it, Harry,' Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder, 'he's just . . . '\n    But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room. Neville and Ron both gave Harry an it's-his-problem-not-yours look, but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this would he have to take? 'What's the matter? ' asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast. 'You look absolutely - Oh for heavens sake. '\n    She was staring at the common-room noticeboard, where a large new sign had been put up. GALLONS OF GALLEONS!"

'Gone,' said Harry calmly. Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry's robes with his eyes. 'How do I know you haven't got it in your pocket? '\n    'Because - '\n    'I saw him send it,' said Cho angrily. Filch rounded on her. 'You saw him - ? '\n    That's right, I saw him,' she said fiercely. There was a moment's pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry. 'If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . . '\n    He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him. Harry and Cho looked at each other. Thanks,' Harry said. No problem,' said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl's other leg, her face slightly pink. 'You weren't ordering Dungbombs, were you? '\n    'No,' said Harry. 'I wonder why he thought you were, then? ' she said as she carried the owl to the window. Harry shrugged. He was quite as mystified by that as she was, though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment. They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle, Cho said, 'I'm going this way. Well, I'll . . . I'll see you around, Harry. '\n    'Yeah . . . see you. '\n    She smiled at him and departed. Harry walked on, feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once . . . you were really brave standing up to her like that . . . Cho had called him brave . . . she did not hate him for being alive . . . Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that . . . though if he'd only asked her to the Ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently . . . she had seemed sincerely sorry that she'd had to refuse when Harry asked her . . . 'Morning,' Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione as he joined them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. 'What are you looking so pleased about? ' said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise. 'Erm . . . Quidditch later,' said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him. 'Oh . . . yeah . . . ' said Ron. He put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, 'Listen . . . you don't fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to - er - give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit. '\n    'Yeah, OK,' said Harry. 'Look, I don't think you should,' said Hermione seriously. 'You're both really behind on homework as it - '\n    But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg. Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off. 'Anything interesting? ' said Ron. Harry grinned, knowing Ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework. 'No,' she sighed, 'just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married. '\n    Hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon. Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied. 'Wait a moment,' said Hermione suddenly. 'Oh no . . . Sirius! '\n    'What's happened? ' said Harry, snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle, with him and Hermione each holding one half. ' \"The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently hiding in London! \" ' Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper. 'Lucius Malfoy, I'll bet anything,' said Harry in a low, furious voice. 'He did recognise Sirius on the platform . . . '\n    What? ' said Ron, looking alarmed. 'You didn't say - '\n    'Shh! ' said the other two. '. . . \"Ministry warns wizarding community that Black is very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . . \" the usual rubbish,' Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. 'Well, he just won't be able to leave the house again, that's all,' she whispered. 'Dumbledore did warn him not to. '\n    Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale. 'Hey! ' he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could see it. 'Look at this! '\n    'I've got all the robes I want,' said Ron 'No,' said Harry. 'Look . . . this little piece here . . . \" Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was headlined:\nTRESPASS AT MINISTRY\nSturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31\" August. Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o'clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak, in his own defence, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban. 'Sturgis Podmore? ' said Ron slowly. 'He's that bloke who looks like his head's been thatched, isn't he? He's one of the Ord-\n    'Ron, shhl' said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them. 'Six months in Azkaban! ' whispered Harry, shocked. 'Just for trying to get through a door! '\n    'Don't be silly, it wasn't just for trying to get through a door. What on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o'clock in the morning? ' breathed Hermione. D'you reckon he was doing something for the Order? ' Ron muttered. 'Wait a moment . . . ' said Harry slowly. 'Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember? '\n    The other two looked at him. 'Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King's Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn't turn up; so he couldn't have been on a job for them, could he? '\n    'Well, maybe they didn't expect him to get caught,' said Hermione. 'It could be a frame-up! ' Ron exclaimed excitedly. 'No - listen! ' he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione's face. The Ministry suspects he's one of Dumbledore's lot so - I dunno - they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn't trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they've just made something up to get him! '\n    There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. Harry thought it seemed far-fetched. Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed. 'Do you know, I wouldn't be at all surprised if that were true. '\n    She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. As Harry laid down his knife and fork, she seemed to come out of a reverie. 'Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on self-fertilising shrubs first and if we're lucky we'll be able to start McGonagall's Inanimatus Conjurus Spell before lunch . . . '\n    Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week . . . 'I mean, we can do it tonight,' said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, and with Hermione's dire warnings that they would fail all their OWLs still ringing in their ears. 'And we've got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that's her trouble . . . ' There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, 'D'you think she meant it when she said we weren't copying from her? '\n    'Yeah, I do,' said Harry. 'Still, this is important, too, we've got to practise if we want to stay on the Quidditch team . . . '\n    'Yeah, that's right,' said Ron, in a heartened tone. 'And we have got plenty of time to do it all . . . '\n    As they approached the Quidditch pitch, Harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn't doing him any harm; he pushed it out of his mind. They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised. After a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunch - during which Hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsible - then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered. All right, Ron? ' said George, winking at him. Yeah,' said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch. 'Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect? ' said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face. 'Shut up,' said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood's, who was rather broader in the shoulder. 'OK, everyone,' said Angelina, entering from the Captain's office, already changed. 'Let's gel to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can jus: bring out the ball crate for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right? '\n    Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium. 'What's that Weasley's riding? ' Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. 'Why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that? '\n    Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind. 'Ignore them,' he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron, 'we'll see who's laughing after we play them . . . '\n    'Exactly the attitude I want, Harry' said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. 'OK, everyone, we're going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please - '\n    'Hey, Johnson, what's with that hairstyle, anyway? ' shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. 'Why would anyone want to look like they've got worms coming out of their head? '\n    Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly, 'Spread out, then, and let's see what we can do . . . '\n    Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back towards the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it. The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter."

'I had to stop you,' Harry gasped, picking up his bag. 'Crabbe and Goyle would've torn you apart. '\n    Neville said nothing; he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon. 'What in the name of Merlin,' said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, 'was that about? '\n    Harry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St Mungo's because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville's secret. Even Neville did not know Harry knew. Harry, Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class, pulled out parchment, quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang, everybody immediately fell silent. 'You will notice,' said Snape, in his low, sneering voice, 'that we have a guest with us today. '\n    He gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most. It was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other. 'We are continuing with our Strengthening Solution today. You will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson; it correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend - instructions - ' he waved his wand again ' - on the board. Carry on. '\n    Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her question Snape; so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again. 'Salamander blood, Harry! ' Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time, 'not pomegranate juice! '\n    'Right,' said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just got to her feet. 'Ha,' he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks towards Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas's cauldron. 'Well, the class seem fairly advanced for their level,' she said briskly to Snape's back. 'Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus. '\n    Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her. 'Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts? ' she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard. 'Fourteen years,' Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. Harry, watching him closely, added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange. 'You applied first for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post, I believe? ' Professor Umbridge asked Snape. 'Yes,' said Snape quietly. 'But you were unsuccessful? '\n    Snape's lip curled. 'Obviously. '\n    Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. 'And you have applied regularly for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe? '\n    'Yes,' said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry. 'Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you? ' asked Umbridge. 'I suggest you ask him,' said Snape jerkily. 'Oh, I shall,' said Professor Umbridge, with a sweet smile. 'I suppose this is relevant? ' Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed. 'Oh yes,' said Professor Umbridge, 'yes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers' - er - backgrounds. '\n    She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape looked round at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a. strong smell of burned rubber. 'No marks again, then, Potter,' said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry's cauldron with a wave of his wand. 'You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand? '\n    'Yes,' said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end. 'Maybe I'll skive off Divination,' he said glumly, as they stood in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. 'I'll pretend to be ill and do Snape's essay instead, then I won't have to stay up half the night. '\n    'You can't skive off Divination,' said Hermione severely. 'Hark who's talking, you walked oui of Divination, you hate Trelawney! ' said Ron indignantly. 'I don't hate her,' said Hermione loftily. 'I just think she's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. But Harry's already missed History of Magic and I don't think he ought to miss anything else today! '\n    There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, overperfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom, feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was yet again handing out copies of The Dream Oracle. Harry thought he'd surely be much better employed doing Snape's\n    punishment essay than sitting here trying to nnd meaning in a lot of made-up dreams. It seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus's head, and thrust the final one into Neville's chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe. 'Well, carry on! ' said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high-pitched and somewhat hysterical, 'you know what to do! Or am I such a sub-standard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book? '\n    The class stared perplexedly at her, then at each other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teachers chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron's and muttered, 'I think she's got the results of her inspection back. '\n    'Professor? ' said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). 'Professor, is there anything - er - wrong? '\n    'Wrong! ' cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. 'Certainly not! I have been insulted, certainly . . . insinuations have been made against me . . . unfounded accusations levelled . . . but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not! '\n    She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses. 'I say nothing,' she choked, 'of sixteen years of devoted service . . . it has passed, apparently, unnoticed . . . but I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not! '\n    'But, Professor, who's insulting you? ' asked Parvati timidly. The Establishment! ' said Professor Trelawney, in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. 'Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted . . . it is - alas - 'our fate. '\n    She gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, and blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look. 'Professor,' said Parvati, 'do you mean . . . is it something Professor Umbridge - ? '\n    'Do not speak to me about that woman! ' cried Professor Trelawney leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing. 'Kindly continue with your work! '\n    And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath. '. . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on probation . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . . '\n    'You and Umbridge have got something in common,' Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defence Against the Dark Arts. 'She obviously reckons Trelawney's an old fraud, too . . . looks like she's put her on probation. '\n    Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness. 'Good afternoon, class. '\n    'Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,' they chanted dully. 'Wands away, please. '\n    But there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands. 'Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled \"The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack\". There will be - '\n    ' - no need to talk,' Harry, Ron and Hermione said together, under their breaths. *\n'No Quidditch practice,' said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the common room after dinner that night. 'But I kept my temper! ' said Harry, horrified. 'I didn't say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I - '\n    'I know, I know, said Angelina miserably. 'She just said she needed a bit of time to consider. '\n    'Consider what? ' said Ron angrily. 'She's given the Slytherins permission, why not us? '\n    But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon. 'Well,' said Hermione, 'look on the bright side - at least now you'll have time to do Snape's essay! '\n    That's a bright side, is it? ' snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. 'No Quidditch practice, and extra Potions? '\n    Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work. It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew Sirius was not due in the fire until much later, he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd. First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily Vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry's potions. What with the regular sounds of retching, cheering and the sound of Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solution. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George's bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs, which Harry found, if anything, more distracting. 'Just go and stop them, then! ' he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time. 'I can't, they're not technically doing anything wrong,' said Hermione through gritted teeth. They're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them, not unless they're proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn't look as though they are. '\n    She, Harry and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause. 'You know, I don't get why Fred and George only got three OWLs each,' said Harry, watching as Fred, George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd. They really know their stuff. '\n    'Oh, they only know flashy stuff that's of no real use to anyone,' said Hermione disparagingly. 'No real use? ' said Ron in a strained voice."

'Hold yer Hippogriffs, I haven' finished me story yet!

I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin' out at 'em,' said Hagrid, the corners of h s mouth lifting his wild beard, 'she was rarin' ter attack 'em . . . she's somethin' when she's roused, Olympe . . . fiery, yeh know . . . 'spect it's the French in her . . . '\n    Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds of reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly. 'So, what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants? '\n    'What? Oh . . . oh, yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave we'd bin hidin' in an' headed back down inter the gully, keepin' our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o' the caves, no go - then, in abou' the sixth one, we found three giants hidin'. '\n    'Cave must've been cramped,' said Ron. 'Wasn' room ter swing a Kneazle,' said Hagrid. 'Didn't they attack you when they saw you? ' asked Hermione. 'Probably woulda done if they'd bin in any condition,' said Hagrid, 'but they was badly hurt, all three o' them; Golgomath's lot had beaten 'em unconscious; they'd woken up an' crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o' them had a bit of English an' 'e translated fer the others, an' what we had ter say didn' seem ter go down too badly. So we kep' goin' back, visitin' the wounded . . . I reckon we had abou' six or seven o' them convinced at one poin'. '\n    'Six or seven? ' said Ron eagerly. 'Well that's not bad - are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us? '\n    But Hermione said, 'What do you mean \"at one point\", Hagrid? '\n    Hagrid looked at her sadly. 'Golgomath's lot raided the caves. The ones tha' survived didn' wan' no more ter to do with us after that. '\n    'So . . . so there aren't any giants coming? ' said Ron, looking disappointed. 'Nope,' said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak and applied the cooler side to his face, 'but we did wha' we meant ter do, we gave 'em Dumbledore's message an' some o' them heard it an' I spect some o' them'll remember it. Jus' maybe, them that don' want ter stay around Golgomath'll move outta the mountains, an' there's gotta be a chance they'll remember Dumbledore's friendly to 'em . . . could be they'll come. '\n    Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through: Fang was drooling with his head in Harry's lap. 'Hagrid? ' said Hermione quietly after a while. 'Mmm? '\n    'Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything asout your . . . your . . . mother while you were there? '\n    Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared. 'I'm sorry . . . I . . . forget it - '\n    'Dead,' Hagrid grunted. 'Died years ago. They told me. '\n    'Oh . . . I'm . . . I'm really sorry,' said Hermione in a very small voice. Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. 'No need,' he said shortly. 'Can't remember her much. Wasn' a great mother. '\n    They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak. 'But you still haven't explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,' Ron said, gesturing towards Hagrid's bloodstained face. 'Or why you're back so late,' said Harry. 'Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago - '\n    'Who attacked you? ' said Ron. 'I haven' bin attacked! ' said Hagrid emphatically. 'I - '\n    But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain. 'It's her! ' Ron whispered. 'Get under here! ' Harry said quickly, seizing the Invisibility Cloak, he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak as well. Huddled together, they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused. 'Hagrid, hide our mugs! '\n    Hagrid seized Harry and Ron's mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang's basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open. Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid's face; she barely reached his navel. 'So,' she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. 'You're Hagrid, are you? '\n    Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction. 'Get away,' she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face. 'Er - I don' want ter be rude,' said Hagrid, staring at her, 'but who the ruddy hell are you? '\n    'My name is Dolores Umbridge. '\n    Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. 'Dolores Umbridge? ' Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. 'I thought you were one o' them Ministry - don' you work with Fudge? '\n    'I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,' said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned travelling cloak."

                "text": "He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him. He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else. The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore . . . if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all. *\nEverybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her. Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later. 'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you. '\n    'What are you doing here? ' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad? '\n    'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas. ' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches. '\n    Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed. 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . . '\n    She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry. 'How're you feeling? ' asked Hermione. 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly. 'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's. '\n    They do, do they? ' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed. 'Well, you have! ' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us! '\n    'It's you lot who won't look at me! ' said Harry angrily. 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching. 'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away. 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\n    'Yeah? ' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it. '\n    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\n    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled. 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels. '\n    Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round. 'I forgot,' he said. 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly. Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then? '\n    'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing? ' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to? '\n    Harry racked his brains. 'No,' he said. Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there. '\n    Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself. 'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\n    'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year. '\n    This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ? '\n    'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry. '\n    'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up. '\n    Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\n    Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice. *\nHow could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards. Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile. 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\n    Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay! '\n    Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed. 'Merry Christmas,' said George. 'Don't go downstairs for a bit. '\n    'Why not? ' said Ron. 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily. 'Percy sent back his Christmas jumper. '\n    'Without a note,' added George. 'Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything. '\n    'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings. '\n    'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. 'So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon. '\n    'What's that supposed to be, anyway? ' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. 'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes. '\n    'It's Harry! ' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back! '\n    'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the \"i\"s and crossed the \"t\"s then you may do whatever you please! '\n    They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling 'Merry Christmas' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione. Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily. 'I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume's really unusual, Ron. '\n    'No problem,' said Ron. 'Who's that for, anyway? ' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying. 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly. 'It had better not be clothes! ' Ron warned her. 'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free! '\n    'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom. '\n    'What bedroom? ' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother. 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione. 'Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen. '\n    Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them 'Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes. 'So, is this Kreacher's bedroom? ' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open. 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. 'Er . . . I think we'd better knock. '\n    Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply. 'He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. 'Urgh! '\n    Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest."

'And I forbid you to hurt yourself! ' he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him. Thank you, Harry Potter! ' squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off. Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast he :aught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished; he started to run right; there was a boys' bathroom up ahead, he could pretend he'd been in there all the time if he could just reach it - '\n    'AAARGH! Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly, skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind him was laughing. He rolled over on to his, back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase. 'Trip Jinx, Potter! ' he said. 'Hey, Professor - PROFESSOR! I've got one! '\n    Umbridge came bustling round the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile. 'It's him! ' she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor, 'Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good - fifty points to Slytherin! I'll take him from here . . . stand up, Potter! '\n    Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. 'You hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, Draco,' she said. 'Tell the others to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls' ones - off you go - and you,' she added in her softest, mos: dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away, 'you can come with me to the Headmaster's office, Potter. '\n    They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron - Mrs Weasley would kill him - and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her OWLs. And it had been Seamus's very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good . . . 'Fizzing Whizzbee,' sang Umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry. The office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation; Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom Harry did not recognise, were positioned either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes. The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of them were alert and serious, watching what was happening below them. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbour's ear. Harry pulled himself free of Umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face. 'Well,' he said. 'Well, well, well . . . '\n    Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear. 'He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,' said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the Entrance Hall. The Malfoy boy cornered him. '\n    'Did he, did he? ' said Fudge appreciatively. 'I must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here? '\n    Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant 'yes': his mouth had opened and the word was half-formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry - his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder - but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side. Harry changed direction mid-word. 'Ye - no. '\n    'I beg your pardon? ' said Fudge. 'No,' said Harry, firmly. You don t know why you are here? '\n    'No, I don't,' said Harry. Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge. Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink. 'So you have no idea,' said Fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, 'why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules? '\n    'School rules? ' said Harry. 'No. '\n    'Or Ministry Decrees? ' amended Fudge angrily. 'Not that I'm aware of,' said Harry blandly. His heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges blood pressure rising, but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them; if somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the DA then he, the leader, might as well be packing his trunk right now. 'So, it's news to you, is it,' said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, 'that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school? '\n    'Yes, it is,' said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face. 'I think, Minister,' said Umbridge silkily from beside him, 'we might make better progress if I fetch our informant. '\n    'Yes, yes, do,' said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. There's nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore? '\n    'Nothing at all, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head. There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho's curly-haired friend, Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands. 'Don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened,' said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, 'it's quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. The Minister is very pleased with you. He'll be telling your mother what a good girl you've been. Marietta's mother, Minister,' she added, looking up at Fudge, 'is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation, Floo Network office - she's been helping us police the Hogwarts lins, you know. '\n    'Jolly good, jolly good! ' said Fudge heartily. 'Like mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don't be shy, let's hear what you've got to - galloping gargoyles! '\n    As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backwards in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire. He cursed, and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke. Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word 'SNEAK'. 'Never mind the spots now, dear,' said Umbridge impatiently, 'just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister - '\n    But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically. 'Oh, very well, you silly girl, I'll tell him,' snapped Umbridge. She hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said, 'Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately, at that point this hex,' she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face, 'came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more. '\n    'Well, now,' said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look, 'it is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge. You did exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its purpose? Who was there? '\n    But Marietta would not speak; she merely shook her head again, her eyes wide and fearful. 'Haven't we got a counter-jinx for this? ' Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face. 'So she can speak freely? '\n    'I have not yet managed to find one,' Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione's jinxing ability 'But it doesn't matter if she won't speak, I can take up the story from here. 'You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog's Head in Hogsmeade - '\n    'And what is your evidence for that? ' cut in Professor McGonagall\n    'I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,' said Umbridge smugly 'He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me - '\n    'Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets! ' said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. 'What an interesting insight into our justice system! '\n    'Blatant corruption! ' roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore's desk. The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not! '\n    Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,' said Dumbledore softly. The purpose of Potters meeting with these students,' continued Professor Umbridge, 'was to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age - '\n    'I think you'll find you're wrong there, Dolores,' said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose. Harry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the Hog's Head there was simply no escaping it. 'Oho! ' said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. 'Yes, do let's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on - '\n    Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter's identical twin in the Hog's Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible Dementors? '\n    Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh. 'Oh, very good, Minister, very good! '\n    Harry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently, too. 'Cornelius, I do not deny - and nor, I am sure, does Harry - 'that he was in the Hog's Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defence Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry Decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry's Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules at all in the Hog's Head. '\n    Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open. Umbridge recovered first. That's all very fine, Headmaster,' she said, smiling sweetly, 'but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four."

                "text": "Indeed, a week after Fred and Georges departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, 'It unscrews the other way. '\n    To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet; he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry. 'Should we say something? ' said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr and Mrs Montague marching inside. 'About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him? '\n    'Course not, he'll recover,' said Ron indifferently. 'Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn't it? ' said Harry in a satisfied voice. He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands. Harry's spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron's grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two. 'Reparo,' said Hermione quickly, mending Ron's cup with a wave of her wand. That's all very well, but what if Montague's permanently injured? '\n    'Who cares? ' said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood up drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. 'Montague shouldn't have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me! '\n    'You? ' she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs, and replacing it in front of her. 'Why should I be worried about you? '\n    'When Mum's next letter finally gets through Umbridge's screening process,' said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, 'I'm going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn't be surprised if she's sent another Howler. '\n    'But - '\n    'It'll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,' said Ron darkly. 'She'll say I should've stopped them leaving, I should've grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something . . . yeah, it'll be all my fault. '\n    'Well, if she dot's say that it'll be very unfair, you couldn't have done anything! But I'm sure she won't, I mean, if it's really true they've got premises in Diagon Alley, they must have been planning this for ages. '\n    'Yeah, but that's another thing, how did they get premises? ' said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him. 'It's a bit dodgy, isn't it? They'll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley. She'll want to know what they've been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold. '\n    'Well, yes, that occurred to me, too,' said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, 'I've been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful. '\n    'He hasn't,' said Harry curtly. 'How do you know? ' said Ron and Hermione together. 'Because - ' Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. 'Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June. '\n    There was a shocked silence, then Hermione's teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor. 'Oh, Harry, you didn't! ' she said. 'Yes, I did,' said Harry mutinously. 'And I don't regret it, either. I didn't need the gold and they'll be great at running a joke shop. '\n    'But this is excellent! ' said Ron, looking thrilled. 'It's all your fault, Harry - Mum can't blame me at all! Can I tell her? '\n    'Yeah, I suppose you'd better,' said Harry dully, \"specially if she thinks they're receiving stolen cauldrons or something. '\n    Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack before long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air. Harry interrupted her before she had even started. 'It's no good nagging me, it's done,' he said firmly. 'Fred and George have got the gold - spent a good bit of it, too, by the sounds of it - and I can't get it back from them and I don't want to. So save your breath, Hermione. '\n    'I wasn't going to say anything about Fred and George! ' she said in an injured voice. Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look. 'No, I wasn't! ' she said angrily. 'As a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he's going to go back to Snape and ask for more Occlumency lessons! '\n    Harry's heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George's dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of what to tell them; he had ended up saying, truthfully, that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it. 'You can't tell me you've stopped having funny dreams,' Hermione\n    said now, 'because Ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night. '\n    Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself. 'You were only muttering a bit,' he mumbled apologetically. 'Something about \"just a bit further\". '\n    'I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,' Harry lied brutally. 'I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the Quaffle. '\n    Ron's ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure; he had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort. Last night, he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres. He had hurried straight towards row number ninety-seven, turned left and run along it . . . it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud . . . just a bit further . . . for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake . . . and before he had reached the end of the row, he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his four-poster. 'You are trying to block your mind, aren't you? ' said. Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. 'You are keeping going with your Occlumency? '\n    'Of course I am,' said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs, that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue. The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind - the part that often spoke in Hermione's voice - now felt guilty on the occasions\n    it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach the journey's end. 'You know,' said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, 'if Montague doesn't recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup. '\n    'Yeah, I s'pose so,' said Harry, glad of a change of subject. 'I mean, we've won one, lost one - if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday - '\n    'Yeah, that's right,' said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to. Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him. *\nThe final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron's abysmal goal-keeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism. 'I mean, I can't get any worse, can I? ' he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. 'Nothing to lose now, is there? '\n    'You know,' said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, 'I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence. '\n    Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head. 'Oh, gosh, I forgot! ' said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. 'Cho will be playing, won't she? '\n    Harry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted. They found seats in the topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, ckar day; Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of 'Weasley is our King'. Lee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George\n    had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto. '. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . Chang,' he said, and Harry felt his stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out on to the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze. . He was not sure what he wanted to happen any more, except that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy. 'And they're off! ' said Lee. 'And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well . . . he's going straight for goal! He's going to shoot - and - and - ' Lee swore very loudly. 'And he's scored. '\n    Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing:\n'Weasley cannot save a thing\nHe cannot block a single ring . . . '\n'Harry,' said a hoarse voice in Harry's ear. 'Hermione . . . '\n    Harry looked round and saw Hagrid's enormous bearded face sticking between the seats. Apparently, he had squeezed his way all along the row behind, for the first- and second-years he had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else. 'Listen,' he whispered, 'can yeh come with me? Now? While ev'ryone's watchin' the match? '\n    'Er . . . can't it wait, Hagrid? ' asked Harry. till the match is over? ' 'No,' said Hagrid. 'No, Harry, it's gotta be now . . . while ev'ryone's lookin' the other way . . . please? '\n    Hagrid's nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him this close-up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone. 'Course,' said Harry at once, 'course we'll come. '\n    He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them."

                "text": "'\n    He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration. 'Very well,' she said, and she pulled out her wand. 'Very well . . . I am left with no alternative . . . this is more than a matter of school discipline . . . this is an issue of Ministry security . . . yes . . . yes . . . '\n    She seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily As he watched her, Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand. 'You are forcing me, Potter . . . I do not want to,' said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, 'but sometimes circumstances justify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice . . . '\n    Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face. The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,' said Umbridge quietly. 'No! ' shrieked Hermione. 'Professor Umbridge - it's illegal. '\n    But Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand. The Minister wouldn't want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge! ' cried Hermione. 'What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him,' said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry's body in turn, apparently trying to decide where it would hurt most. 'He never knew I ordered Dementors to go after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same. '\n    'It was you? ' gasped Harry. 'You sent the Dementors after me? '\n    'Somebody had to act,' breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry's forehead. They were all bleating about silencing you somehow - discrediting you - but I was the one who actually did something about it . . . only you wriggled out of that one, didn't you, Potter? Not today though, not now - ' And taking a deep breath, she cried, 'Cruc-\n    'NO! ' shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. 'No - Harry - we'll have to tell her! '\n    'No way! ' yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could see. 'We'll have to, Harry, she'll force it out of you anyway, what's . . . what's the point? '\n    And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted. 'Well, well, well! ' said Umbridge, looking triumphant. 'Little Miss Question-all is going to give us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on! '\n    'Er - my - nee - no! ' shouted Ron through his gag. Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before. Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her, too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. 'I'm - I'm sorry everyone,' said Hermione. 'But - I can't stand it - '\n    That's right, that's right, girl! ' said Umbridge, seizing Hermione by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her. 'Now then . . . with whom was Potter communicating just now? '\n    'Well,' gulped Hermione into her hands, 'well, he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore. '\n    Ron froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor's toes; and even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs\n    'Dumbledore? ' said Umbridge eagerly. 'You know where Dumbledore is, then? '\n    'Well . . . no! ' sobbed Hermione. 'We've tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog's Head - '\n    'Idiot girl - Dumbledore won't be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry's looking for him! ' shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face. 'But - but we needed to tell him something important! ' wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears. 'Yes? ' said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. 'What was it you wanted to tell him? '\n    'We . . . we wanted to tell him it's r - ready! ' choked Hermione. 'What's ready? ' demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione's shoulders again and shook her slightly. 'What's ready, girl? '\n    The . . . the weapon,' said Hermione. 'Weapon? Weapon? ' said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement. 'You have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor Dumbledore's orders, of course? '\n    'Y - y - yes,' gasped Hermione, 'but he had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now we've finished it for him, and we c - c - can't find him t - t - to tell him! '\n    'What kind of weapon is it? ' said Umbridge harshly, her stubby hands still tight on Hermione's shoulders. 'We don't r - r - really understand it,' said Hermione, sniffing loudly. 'We j - j - just did what P - P - Professor Dumbledore told us t - t - to do. '\n    Umbridge straightened up, looking exultant. 'Lead me to the weapon,' she said. 'I'm not showing . . . them,' said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers. 'It is not for you to set conditions,' said Professor Umbridge harshly. 'Fine,' said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again. Tine . . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th - that would serve you right - oh, I'd love it if the wh - whole school knew where it was, and how to u - use it, and then if you annoy any of them they'll, be able to s - sort you out! '\n    These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge: she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his lace. Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment, then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. 'All right, dear, let's make it just you and me . . . and we'll take Potter, loo, shall we? Get up, now. '\n    'Professor,' said Malfoy eagerly, 'Professor Umbridge, I think some of the Squad should come with you to look after - '\n    'I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone? ' asked Umbridge sharply. 'In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will\n    remain here until I return and make sure none of these - she gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna ' - escape. '\n    'All right,' said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed. 'And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,' said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. 'Lead on. '\n- CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE -\nFight and Flight\nHarry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge's office, knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing. Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall - it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world . . . Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass - Umbridge jogging to keep up - their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks. 'It's hidden in Hagrid's hut, is it? ' said Umbridge eagerly in Harry's ear. 'Of course not,' said Hermione scathingly. 'Hagrid might have set it off accidentally. '\n    'Yes,' said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. 'Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf. '\n    She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill. 'Then . . . where is it? asked Umbridge, with a hint or uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride towards the Forest. 'In there, of course,' said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. 'It had to be somewhere that students weren't going to find it accidentally, didn't it? '\n    'Of course,' said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now. 'Of course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of me. '\n    'Can we have your wand, then, if we're going first? ' Harry asked her. 'No, I don't think so, Mr Potter,' said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it. The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I'm afraid. '\n    As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione s eye; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up. 'Is it very far in? ' Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble. 'Oh yes,' said Hermione, 'yes, it's well hidden. '\n    Harry's misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it. 'Er - are you sure this is the right way? ' he asked her pointedly. 'Oh yes,' she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, 'It's a bit further in! '\n    'Hermione, keep your voice down,' Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her. 'Anything could be listening in here - '\n    'I want us heard,' she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. 'You'll see . . . '\n    They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes. 'How much further? ' demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him. 'Not far now! ' shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. 'Just a little bit - '\n    An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield - '\n    He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant smile. 'Who are you? ' said a voice. Harry looked left."

                "text": "'\n    Harry nodded. 'Ought I to have told you then? '\n    Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was racing again. 'You do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age. 'I should have recognised the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognised that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day . . . you were too young, much too young. 'And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced; once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark on you. We discussed your scar, oh yes . . . we came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything;\n    'Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph . . . 'Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid. '\n    'I don't - '\n    'I cared about you too much,' said Dumbledore simply. 'I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. 'Is there a defence? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have - and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined - not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands. 'We entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled to repel Dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon . . . 'But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you\n    before this. My only defence is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and I could not bring myself to add another - the greatest one of all. '\n    Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak. 'I still don't understand. '\n    'Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you. '\n    The sun had risen fully now: Dumbledore's office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes. The prophecy's smashed,' Harry said blankly. 'I was pulling Neville up those benches in the - the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell . . . '\n    The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly. '\n    'Who heard it? ' asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already. 'I did,' said Dumbledore. 'On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave. '\n    Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes's perch. He bent down, slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip. A figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sybill Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before:\n    'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches . . . born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies . . . and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not . . . and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives . . . the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies . . . '\n    The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished. The silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent. 'Professor Dumbledore? ' Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. 'It . . . did that mean . . . what did that mean? '\n    'It meant,' said Dumbledore, 'that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times. '\n    Harry felt as though something was closing in on him. His breathing seemed difficult again. 'It means - me? '\n    Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses. The odd thing, Harry,' he said softly, 'is that it may not have meant you at all. Sybill's prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom. '\n    'But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville's? '\n    The official record was re-labelled after Voldemort's attack on you as a child,' said Dumbledore. 'It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring. '\n    'Then - it might not be me? ' said Harry. 'I am afraid,' said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, 'that there is no doubt that it is you. '\n    'But you said - Neville was born at the end of July, too - and his mum and dad - '\n    'You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort . . . Voldemort himself would mark him as his equal. And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse. '\n    'But he might have chosen wrong! ' said Harry. 'He might have marked the wrong person! '\n    'He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,' said Dumbledore. 'And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pure-blood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far - something that neither your parents, nor Neville's parents, ever achieved. '\n    'Why did he do it, then? ' said Harry, who felt numb and cold. 'Why did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then - '\n    That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,' said Dumbledore, 'except that Voldemort's information about the prophecy was incomplete. The Hog's Head inn, which Sybill chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sybill Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing. My - our - one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building. '\n    'So he only heard - ? '\n    'He heard only the beginning, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more. He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not - '\n    'But I don't! ' said Harry, in a strangled voice. 'I haven't any powers he hasn't got, I couldn't fight the way he did tonight, I can't possess people or - or kill them - '\n    There is a room in the Department of Mysteries,' interrupted Dumbledore, 'that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you. '\n    Harry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died . . . More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, The end of the prophecy . . . it was something about . . . neither can live . . . '\n    '. . . while the other survives,' said Dumbledore."

It's quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-scopes and make sure the neighbors don't spot you bringing in the piano. \"\n\"Ingenious,\" said Dumbledore. \"But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts ��\"\n\"If you're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that's how you treat teachers these days ��\"\n\"Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs 'filthy half-breeds. '\"\n\"That's what she did, did she? \" said Slughorn. \"Idiotic woman. Never liked her. \"\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him. \"Sorry,\" Harry said hastily. \"It's just �� I didn't like her either. \"\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly. \"Are you leaving? \" asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful. \"No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,\" said Dumbledore. \"Oh,\" said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. \"Second on the left down the hall. \"\nDumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind. \"Don't think I don't know why he's brought you,\" he said abruptly. Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn's watery eyes slid over Harry's scar, this time taking in the rest of his face. \"You look very like your father. \"\n\"Yeah, I've been told,\" said Harry. \"Except for your eyes. You've got ��-\"\n\"My mother's eyes, yeah. \" Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing. \"Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn't have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,\" Slughorn added, in answer to Harry��s questioning look. \"Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too. \" <\n\"Which was your House? \"\n\"I was Head of Slytherin,\" said Slughorn. \"Oh, now,\" he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry's face and wagging a stubby ringer at him, \"don't go holding that against me! You'll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done �� been in the papers for the last couple of years �� died a few weeks ago ��\"\nIt was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry's intestines and held them tight. \"Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father's at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame �� he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I'd have liked the set. \"\nHe sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside. \"Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good. \"\n\"One of my best friends is Muggle-born,\" said Harry, \"and she's the best in our year. \"\n\"Funny how that sometimes happens, isn't it? \" said Slughorn. \"Not really,\" said Harry coldly. Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. \"You mustn't think I'm prejudiced! \" he said. \"No, no, no! Haven't I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too �� now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course �� another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts! \"\nHe bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants. \"All ex-students, all signed. You'll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he's always interested to hear my take on the day's news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes �� a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job! And at the back �� you'll see her if you just crane your neck �� that's Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People are always astonished to hear I'm on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them! \"\nThis thought seemed to cheer him up enormously. \"And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff? \" asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him. The smile slid from Slughorn's face as quickly as the blood from his walls. \"Of course not,\" he said, looking down at Harry. \"I have been out of touch with everybody for a year. \"\nHarry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged. \"Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hog-warts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I'm sure they're very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don't personally fancy the mortality rate ��-\"\n\"You don't have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,\" said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn's cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. \"Most of the teachers aren't in it, and none of them has ever been killed �� well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort. \"\nHarry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort's name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored. \"I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore's headmaster; he's supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn't he? \" Harry went on. Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harry's words. \"Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,\" he muttered grudgingly. \"And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. . . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones's death did not shake me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . . \"\nDumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house. \"Oh, there you are, Albus,\" he said. \"You've been a very long lime. Upset stomach? \"\n\"No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,\" said Dumbledore. \"I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace's hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave. \"\nNot at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn sinned taken aback. \"You're leaving? \"\n\"Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one. \"\n\"Lost. . . ? \"\nSlughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. \"Well, I'm sorry you don't want the job, Horace,\" said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. \"Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to. \"\n\"Yes . . . well . . . very gracious . . . as I say . . . \"\n\"Good-bye, then. \"\n\"Bye,\" said Harry. They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them. \"All right, all right, I'll do it! \"\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room. \"You will come out of retirement? \"\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Slughorn impatiently. \"I must be mad, but yes. \"\n\"Wonderful,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"Then, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September. \"\n\"Yes, I daresay you will,\" grunted Slughorn. As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn's voice floated after them, \"I'll want a pay rise, Dumbledore! \"\nDumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist. \"Well done, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"I didn't do anything,\" said Harry in surprise. \"Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him? \"\n\"Er. . . \"\nHarry wasn't sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch. \"Horace,\" said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, \"likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat �� more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, some-limcs for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office. \"\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer. \"I tell you all this,\" Dumbledore continued, \"not to turn you against Horace �� or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn �� but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; 'the Boy Who Lived' . . . or, as they call you these days, 'the Chosen One. '\"\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives . . . Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier. \"This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm. \"\nBraced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there . . . and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew. . . ."

                "text": "Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing. \"What's wrong with this thing? \" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry's foot. Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly\nbelow him. \"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want? \"\n\"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini,\nwho was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find\nmany. \"\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy. \"Who else had he invited? \" he demanded. \"McLaggen from Gryffindor,\" said Zabini. \"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,\" said Malfoy. \"? someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ? quot;\n\"Not him, he's a prat! \" said Pansy. \"? and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,\" finished Zabini. Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy's hand aside. \"He invited Longbottom? . \"\n\"Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\" said Zabini indifferently. \"What's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn? \"\nZabini shrugged. \"Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Chosen One,'\" sneered Malfoy, \"but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her? ? /p> \n\"A lot of boys like her,\" said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \"Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please! \"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\" said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. \"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or ? quot;\n\"I wouldn't bank on an invitation,\" said Zabini. \"He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old\nfriends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Dearh Eaters. \"\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh. \"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher. \" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \"I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not? \"\n\"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year? \" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once. \"Well, you never know,\" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \"I might have ? er ? moved on to bigger and better things. \"\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded. \"Do you mean \nMalfoy shrugged. \"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . . When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N. E. W. T. S anyone's got? Of course he isn't? It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown. \"\n\"And you think you'll be able to do something for him? \" asked\nZabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet? \"\n\"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly. Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring. \"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on. \"\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning. Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed. \"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something. \"\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend? \"Petrificus Totalus! \"\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly. \"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . . \"\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers. \"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here . . . \"\n-=-Him\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere. \"That's from my father. Now, let's see. . . . \"\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him. \"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter . . . or not. \"\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment. Chapter 8:  Victorious Snape\n\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the _ Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in. . . and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk. Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London. He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \"Accio Wand! \" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened. He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \"Wotcher, Harry. \"\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiv Cloak she had just pulled away. We'd better get out of here, quickly,\" she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. \"Come on, we'll jump. \"\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view. The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak. ��Who did it? \"\n��Draco Malfoy,�� said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for. . . well. . . \" \n��No problem,�� said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your nose if you stand still."

                "text": "\"What's this? Feelin' sorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat? \" \n\"No,\" said Harry at once. \"We wanted to see you. \" \n\"We've missed you! \" said Hermione tremulously. \"Missed me, have yeh? \" snorted Hagrid. \"Yeah. Righ'. \" \nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid's cooking, and took one at once. \"Hagrid,\" said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that sug-gested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \"we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know. \" Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner. \"We did! \" said Hermione. \"But none of us could fit it into our schedules! \" \n\"Yeah. Righ',\" said Hagrid again. There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. \"What are they, Hagrid? \" asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same. \"Jus' giant grubs,\" said Hagrid. \"And they grow into . . . ? \" said Ron, looking apprehensive. \"They won' grow inter nuthin',\" said Hagrid. \"I got 'em ter feed ter Aragog. \" \nAnd without warning, he burst into tears. \"Hagrid! \" cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \"What is it? \" \n\"It's. . . him . . . \" gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. \"It's . . . Aragog. . . . I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better. . . . I don' know what I'll do if he . . . if he . . . We've bin tergether so long. . . . \" \nHermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Ha-grid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously. \"Is there �� is there anything we can do? \" Hermione asked, ig-noring Ron's frantic grimaces and head-shakings. \"I don' think there is, Hermione,\" choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. \"See, the rest o' the tribe . . . Aragog's family . . . they're gettin' a bit funny now he's ill. . . bit restive . . . \" \n\"Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,\" said Ron in an undertone. \". . . I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo',\" Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \"But thanks fer offerin', Hermione. . . . It means a lot. . . . \" \nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and be-came his usual self once more. \"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\" he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \"Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners ��\" \n\"We couldn't have done,\" said Hermione. \"We smashed the en-tire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last sum-mer. It was in the Daily Prophet. \" \n\"Ar, well then,\" said Hagrid. \"There's no way yeh could've done it. . . . I'm sorry I've bin �� yeh know �� I've jus' bin worried about Aragog . . . an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh ��\" \nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful. \"I'm starving,\" said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack-ing noise from one of his back teeth. \"And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner. . . . \" \nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en-tering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back. \"What? \" said Hermione defensively. \"If you ask me,\" said Harry quietly, \"McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting. \" \nHermione blushed. \"Oh, all right then, I did it,\" she whispered. \"But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Any-way, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in �� you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team. \" \n\"No,\" said Harry. \"No, I suppose that's true. But wasn't that dis-honest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you? \" \n\"Oh, be quiet,\" she snapped, as he smirked. \"What are you two doing? \" demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious. \"Nothing,\" said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry's stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path. \"Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see! \" he boomed ge-nially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, \"I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen com-ing and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin �� I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothe-caries �� and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too. \" \nSlughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him. \"I can't come, Professor,\" said Harry at once. \"I've got a deten-tion with Professor Snape. \" \n\"Oh dear! \" said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \"Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I'll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to per-suade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later! \" He bustled away out of the Hall. \"He's got no chance of persuading Snape,\" said Harry, the mo-ment Slughorn was out of earshot. \"This detentions already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won't do it for anyone else. \" \n\"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own! \" said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen. \"I doubt you'll be alone, Ginny'll probably be invited,\" snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn. After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. \"Anything new? \" said Harry. \"Not really. . . \" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \"Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron �� he's all right! \" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. \"It just says he's been to visit the Malfoys' house. 'This sec-ond search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confis-cation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off. '\" \n\"Yeah, mine! \" said Harry. \"I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it's not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him ��\" \n\"But how can he have done, Harry? \" said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \"We were all searched when we arrived, weren't we? \" \n\"Were you? \" said Harry, taken aback. \"I wasn't! \" \n\"Oh no, of course you weren't, I forgot you were late. . . . Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can't have brought in anything dangerous! \" \nMomentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection. \"Someone's sent it to him by owl, then,\" he said. \"His mother or someone. \" \n\"All the owls are being checked too,\" said Hermione. \"Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach. \" \nReally stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. \"Can you think of any way Malfoy �� ? \" \n\"Oh, drop it, Harry,\" said Ron. \"Listen, it's not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know! \" said Harry, firing up. \"Well, as I'm not invited to any parties,\" said Ron, getting to his feet again, \"I think I'll go to bed. \" \nHe stomped off toward the door to the boys' dormitories, leav-ing Harry and Hermione staring after him. \"Harry? \" said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. \"I've got a message for you. \" \n\"From Professor Slughorn? \" asked Harry, sitting up hopefully. \"No . . . from Professor Snape,\" said Demelza. Harry's heart sank. \"He says you're to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention �� er �� no matter how many party invita-tions you've received. And he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and �� and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves. \" \n\"Right,\" said Harry grimly. \"Thanks a lot, Demelza. \" \n  \n\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\n\n\nWhere was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next lew weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned."

                "text": "\"What's this? Feelin' sorry for me? Reckon I'm lonely or summat? \" \n\"No,\" said Harry at once. \"We wanted to see you. \" \n\"We've missed you! \" said Hermione tremulously. \"Missed me, have yeh? \" snorted Hagrid. \"Yeah. Righ'. \" \nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid's cooking, and took one at once. \"Hagrid,\" said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that sug-gested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \"we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know. \" Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner. \"We did! \" said Hermione. \"But none of us could fit it into our schedules! \" \n\"Yeah. Righ',\" said Hagrid again. There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing. \"What are they, Hagrid? \" asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same. \"Jus' giant grubs,\" said Hagrid. \"And they grow into . . . ? \" said Ron, looking apprehensive. \"They won' grow inter nuthin',\" said Hagrid. \"I got 'em ter feed ter Aragog. \" \nAnd without warning, he burst into tears. \"Hagrid! \" cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \"What is it? \" \n\"It's. . . him . . . \" gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-ing as he mopped his face with his apron. \"It's . . . Aragog. . . . I think he's dyin'. . , . He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better. . . . I don' know what I'll do if he . . . if he . . . We've bin tergether so long. . . . \" \nHermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Ha-grid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously. \"Is there �� is there anything we can do? \" Hermione asked, ig-noring Ron's frantic grimaces and head-shakings. \"I don' think there is, Hermione,\" choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. \"See, the rest o' the tribe . . . Aragog's family . . . they're gettin' a bit funny now he's ill. . . bit restive . . . \" \n\"Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,\" said Ron in an undertone. \". . . I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo',\" Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \"But thanks fer offerin', Hermione. . . . It means a lot. . . . \" \nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and be-came his usual self once more. \"Ar, I always knew yeh'd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\" he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \"Even if yeh applied fer Time-Turners ��\" \n\"We couldn't have done,\" said Hermione. \"We smashed the en-tire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last sum-mer. It was in the Daily Prophet. \" \n\"Ar, well then,\" said Hagrid. \"There's no way yeh could've done it. . . . I'm sorry I've bin �� yeh know �� I've jus' bin worried about Aragog . . . an I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin' yeh ��\" \nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful. \"I'm starving,\" said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack-ing noise from one of his back teeth. \"And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner. . . . \" \nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en-tering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione's arm and held her back. \"What? \" said Hermione defensively. \"If you ask me,\" said Harry quietly, \"McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting. \" \nHermione blushed. \"Oh, all right then, I did it,\" she whispered. \"But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Any-way, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in �� you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team. \" \n\"No,\" said Harry. \"No, I suppose that's true. But wasn't that dis-honest, Hermione? I mean, you're a prefect, aren't you? \" \n\"Oh, be quiet,\" she snapped, as he smirked. \"What are you two doing? \" demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious. \"Nothing,\" said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry's stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path. \"Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see! \" he boomed ge-nially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, \"I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen com-ing and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin �� I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothe-caries �� and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too. \" \nSlughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him. \"I can't come, Professor,\" said Harry at once. \"I've got a deten-tion with Professor Snape. \" \n\"Oh dear! \" said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \"Dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I'll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I'm sure I'll be able to per-suade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I'll see you both later! \" He bustled away out of the Hall. \"He's got no chance of persuading Snape,\" said Harry, the mo-ment Slughorn was out of earshot. \"This detentions already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won't do it for anyone else. \" \n\"Oh, I wish you could come, I don't want to go on my own! \" said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen. \"I doubt you'll be alone, Ginny'll probably be invited,\" snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn. After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair. \"Anything new? \" said Harry. \"Not really. . . \" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \"Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron �� he's all right! \" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. \"It just says he's been to visit the Malfoys' house. 'This sec-ond search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confis-cation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off. '\" \n\"Yeah, mine! \" said Harry. \"I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it's not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him ��\" \n\"But how can he have done, Harry? \" said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \"We were all searched when we arrived, weren't we? \" \n\"Were you? \" said Harry, taken aback. \"I wasn't! \" \n\"Oh no, of course you weren't, I forgot you were late. . . . Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can't have brought in anything dangerous! \" \nMomentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection. \"Someone's sent it to him by owl, then,\" he said. \"His mother or someone. \" \n\"All the owls are being checked too,\" said Hermione. \"Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach. \" \nReally stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. \"Can you think of any way Malfoy �� ? \" \n\"Oh, drop it, Harry,\" said Ron. \"Listen, it's not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know! \" said Harry, firing up. \"Well, as I'm not invited to any parties,\" said Ron, getting to his feet again, \"I think I'll go to bed. \" \nHe stomped off toward the door to the boys' dormitories, leav-ing Harry and Hermione staring after him. \"Harry? \" said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. \"I've got a message for you. \" \n\"From Professor Slughorn? \" asked Harry, sitting up hopefully. \"No . . . from Professor Snape,\" said Demelza. Harry's heart sank. \"He says you're to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention �� er �� no matter how many party invita-tions you've received. And he wanted you to know you'll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and �� and he says there's no need to bring protective gloves. \" \n\"Right,\" said Harry grimly. \"Thanks a lot, Demelza. \" \n  \n\nChapter 12: Silver and opals\n\n\nWhere was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next lew weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned."

Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn's party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the B urrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior. . . But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining po ssessions and followed her. He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girl's bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back. \"Oh, hello, Harry , \" said Luna . \" D id you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow? \" \n  \n\"Hi, Luna. Hermione , you left your stuff. . . \" \n\nHe held out her books. \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case. \"Thank you , Harry. Well, I'd better get going. . . \" \n  \nAnd she hurried off, without ever giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any. \"She's a bit upset , \" said Luna. \"I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about Ron Weasley. . . \" \n  \n\"Yeah, they've had a row,\" said Harry. \"He says funny things sometimes, doesn't he? \" said Luna as they set off down the corridor together. \"But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year. \" \n  \n\" I s'pose , \" said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \"So have you had a good term? \" \n  \n\"Oh, it's been al l right,\" said Luna. \" A bit lonely without the D. A. Ginny's been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me 'Loony' the other day --\" \n  \n\"How would you like to come to S lughorn's party with me tonight? \" \n  \nThe words were out of Harry's mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking. Luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise. \"Slughorn's party? With you? \"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"We're supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like. . I mean. . . \" He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \" I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don't want to. . . \" \n\nHe was already half hoping that she didn't want to. \"O h no, I'd love to go with you as friends! \" said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \"Nobody's ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I dye mine too? \"\n\n\"No\" said Harry firmly, \"That was a mistake. I'll get Hermione to put it right for me. So I'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . \" \n  \n\"AHA! \" screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them. \"Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony! \" \nAnd he zoomed away cackling and shrieking, \"Potty loves Loony! \" \n\"Nice to keep these things private,\" said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn's party. \"You could've taken anyone! \" said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \"Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood? \" \n  \n\"Don't call her that, Ron! \" snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \"I'm really glad you're taking her Harry, she's so excited. \" \n  \nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively. \"You could say sorry , \" suggested Harry bluntly. \"What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries? \" muttered Ron. \"What did you have to imitate her for? \" \n\"She laughed at my mustache! \" \n\"So did I, it was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. \" \n  \nBut Ron did not seem to have he a rd; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron's neck. \"Hi, Harry,\" said Parvati who, like Harry, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends. \"Hi,\" said Harry, \"How're you? You're staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave. \" \n  \n\"I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being,\" said Parvati. \"That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn't been anything since. . . Oh, hi, Hermione! \" \n  \nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. \"Hi, Parvati! \" said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \"Are you going to Slughorn's party tonight? \" \n  \n\"No invite,\" said Parvati gloomily. \"I'd love to go, though, it sounds like it's going to be really good. . . You're going, aren't you? \" \n  \n\"Yes, I'm meeting Cormac at eight, and we're -\" \n  \nThere was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink , and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything. \"- we're going up to the party together. \" \n  \n\"Cormac? \" said Parvati. \"Cormac McLaggen, you mean? \" \n  \n\"That's right,\" said Hermione sweetly. \"The one who *almost*\" - she put a great deal of emphasis on the word - \"bec a me Gryffindor Keeper. \" \n  \n\"Are you going out with him, then? \" asked Parvati, wide-eyed. \"Oh - yes - didn't you know? \" said Harmione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle. \"No! \" said Parvati, looking positively agog at thi s piece of gossip. \"Wow , you like your Quidditch players, don't you? First Krum, then McLaggen. . . \" \n  \n\"I like *really good* Quidditch players,\" Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \"Well, see you. . . Got to go and get ready for the party. . . \" \n  \nShe left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o'clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Shall we get going then? \" \n  \n\"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Where is the party? \" \n  \n\"Slughorn's office,\" said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \"Did you hear, there's supposed to be a vampire coming? \" \n  \n\"Rufus Scrimgeour? \" asked Luna. \"I - what? \" said Harry, disconcerted. \"You mean the Minister of Magic? \" \n  \n\"Yes, he's a vampire,\" said Luna matter-of-factly. \"Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn't want the truth to get out! \" \n  \nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father's bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn's office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took. Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn's office was much larger than the usual teacher's study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson , and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables. \"Harry, m'boy! \" boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \"Come in, come in, so many people I'd like you to meet! \" \n  \nSlughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry's arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna's hand and dragged her along with him. \"Harry, I'd like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of ' Blood Brothers: My L ife Amongst the Vampires' - and, of course, his friend Sanguini. \" \n  \nWorple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry's hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited. \"Harry Potter, I am simply delighted! \" said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry's face. \"I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, 'Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting? '\" \n  \n\"Er,\" said Harry, \"were you?"

                "text": "Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes. \" \n  \n\"At Borgin and Burkes? \" Harry repeated, stunned. \"At Borgin and Burkes,\" repeated Dumbledore calmly. \"I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey's memory. But this was not Voldemort's first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time �� I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided �� but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher. \" \n  \n\"He wanted to stay here? Why? \" asked Harry, more amazed still. \"I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,\" said Dumbledore. \"Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home. \" \n  \nHarry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too. \"Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap. \"And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army. \" \n  \n\"But he didn't get the job, sir? \" \n  \n\"No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach. \" \n  \n\"How did you feel about that, sir? \" asked Harry hesitantly. \"Deeply uneasy,\" said Dumbledore. \"I had advised Armando against the appointment �� I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power. \" \n  \n\"Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach? \" \n  \nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years. \"So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this. \" \n  \n\"I'll bet he was,\" said Harry, unable to contain himself. \"Well, quite,\" said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \"And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith. \" \n  \nDumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, \"After you, Harry. \" \n  \nHarry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers. \"Hurry up, Hokey! \" said Hepzibah imperiously. \"He said he'd come at four, it's only a couple of minutes to and he's never been late yet! \" \n  \nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf's head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah's chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga. \"How do I look? \" said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror. \"Lovely, madam,\" squeaked Hokey. Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey��s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion. A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped. \"Quick, quick, he's here, Hokey! \" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory. The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah's fat little hand, brushing it with his lips. \"I brought you flowers,\" he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere. \"You naughty boy, you shouldn't have! \" squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \"You do spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit down, sit down. . . . Where's Hokey? Ah . . . \" \n  \nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress's elbow. \"Help yourself, Tom,\" said Hepzibah, \"I know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I've said it a hundred times. . . . \" \n  \nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered. . |,! \"Well, what's your excuse for visiting this time? \" she asked, bat-ring her lashes. \"Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\" said Voldemort. \"Five hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair ��\" \n  \n\"Now, now, not so fast, or I��ll think you're only here for my trinkets! \" pouted Hepzibah. \"I am ordered here because of them,\" said Voldemort quietly. \"I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire ��\" \n  \n\"Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey! \" said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \"I've something to show you that I've never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won't tell Mr. Burke I've got it? He'd never let me rest if he knew I'd shown it to you, and I'm not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you'll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it. \" \n  \n\"I'd be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\" said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle. \"I had Hokey bring it out for me . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. . . . In fact, bring both, while you're at it. . . . \" \n  \n\"Here, madam,\" squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, ***pouffes, and footstools. \"Now,\" said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, \"I think you'll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can't wait to get their hands on this! \" \n  \nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles. \"I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look! \" whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah��s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort's handsome features. \"A badger,\" murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \"Then this was . . . ? \" \n  \n\"Helga Hufflepuff 's, as you very well know, you clever boy! \" said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \"Didn't I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn't it? And all sorts of powers it's supposed to possess too, but I haven't tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . . \" \n  \nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort's face as the cup was taken away. \"Now then,\" said Hepzibah happily, \"where��s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are �� take that away now, Hokey. \" \n  \nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap. \"I think you'll like this even more, Tom,\" she whispered. \"Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I've got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he'd love to get it back when I'm gone. . . . \" \n  \nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket. Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it. \"Slytherin's mark,\" he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S. \"That's right! \" said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \"I had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn't let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value ��\" \n  \nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort's eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket's chain. \"�� I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn't it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . . \" \n  \nShe reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion. ��So there you are, Tom, clear, and I hope you enjoyed that!"

I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him. \" \n  \n\"The locket! \" said Harry loudly, \"Hufflepuff's cup! \" \n  \n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet �� perhaps not my other hand �� but a couple of fingers, that they be-came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I can-not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe. \" \n  \nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir? \" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders? \" \n  \n\"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two �� he may have found three �� that is the best we can do for now. \" \n  \n\"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he��s got both? \" \n  \n\"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini? ' \n  \n\"The snake? \" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes? \" \n  \n\"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the inten-tion of killing you. He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mys-tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth. \" \n  \n\"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's? \" \n  \n\"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dum-bledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school? \" \n  \n\"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think. . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding an-other one. There are hopeful signs. \" \n  \n\"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it? \" \n  \nDumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so. \" \n  \n\"I can? \" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right. \" \n  \nHarry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it? \" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold. \" \n  \n\"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts? \" \n  \n\"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-ished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius��s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-ters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence �� but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment. \" \n  \nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort couldbe killed? \" \n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes. \" \n  \n\"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, be-fore he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can ��\" \n\"I know! \" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love! \" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal! \" \n  \n\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry. \" \n  \n\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means �� love? \" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes �� just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him �� and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-gerous to him! \" \n  \n\"But it comes to the same ��\" \n  \n\"No, it doesn't! \" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy! \" \n  \n\"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means  \n  \n\"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Ho you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled? \" \n  \n\"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other ��\" \n  \n\"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons! \" \n  \n\"But ��\" \n  \n\"It is essential that you understand this! \" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-est desire to become one of Voldemort's followers! \" \n  \n\"Of course I haven't! \" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad! \" \n  \n\"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! \" said Dum-bledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-ror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole. \" \n  \n\"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-mentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ��\" \n  \n\"Got to? \" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, \nthat you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think! \" \n  \nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sinus. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done."

                "text": "Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realised that I suspected you. ' \nMalfoy winced at the sound of the name. 'I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,' continued Dumbledore. 'But now at last we can speak plainly to each other . . . no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived . . . I can help you, Draco. ' \n'No, you can't,' said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. 'Nobody can. He told me to do it or he'll kill me. I've got no choice. ' \n'Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban . . . when the time comes we can protect him too . . . come over to the right side, Draco . . . you are not a killer . . . ' \nMalfoy stared at Dumbledore. 'But I got this far, didn't I? ' he said slowly. They thought I'd die in the attempt, but I'm here . . . and you're in my power . . . I'm the one with the wand . . . you're at my mercy . . . ' \n'No, Draco,' said Dumbledore quietly. 'It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now. ' \nMalfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction - \nBut suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ram-parts. Still paralysed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: it seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below. A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle. 'Dumbledore cornered! ' he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. 'Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done! ' \n'Good evening, Amycus,' said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. 'And you've brought Alecto too . . . charming . . . ' \nThe woman gave an angry little titter. Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then? ' she jeered. 'Jokes? No, no, these are manners,' replied Dumbledore. 'Do it,' said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater's robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails. 'Is that you, Fenrir? ' asked Dumbledore. That's right,' rasped the other. 'Pleased to see me, Dumbledore? ' \n'No, I cannot say that I am . . . ' \nFenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely. 'But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore. ' \n'Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual . . . you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month? ' \nThat's right,' said Greyback. 'Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you? ' \n'Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,' said Dumbledore. 'And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live. . . ' \n'I didn't,' breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. 'I didn't know he was going to come -' \n'I wouldn't want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,' rasped Greyback. 'Not when there are throats to be ripped out . . . delicious, delicious . . . ' \nAnd he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore. '1 could do you for afters, Dumbledore . . . ' \n'No,' said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. 'We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly. ' \nMalfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall. 'He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me! ' said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. 'Look at him - what's happened to you, then, Dumby? ' \n'Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,' said Dumbledore. 'Old age, in short . . . one day, perhaps, it will happen to you . . . if you are lucky . . . ' \n'What's that mean, then, what's that mean? ' yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. 'Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it! ' \nBut at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, 'They've blocked the stairs - Reducto! REDUCTO! '\nHarry's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them - \n'Now, Draco, quickly! ' said the brutal-faced man angrily. But Malfoy's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim. Til do it,' snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared. 'I said no! ' shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell -if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak - \n'Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us -' screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy. 'We've got a problem, Snape,' said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, 'the boy doesn't seem able -' \nBut somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly. 'Severus . . . ' \nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed. Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face. 'Severus . . . please . . . \" \nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. 'Avada Kedavra! '\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. Chapter 28: Flight of the Prince\nHarry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. . . . \"Out of here, quickly,\" said Snape. He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door. \"Petrificus Totalus! \" \nThe Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase. Terror tore at Harry;s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were linked. . . . He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . . Dumbledore could not have died. . . . He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \"It's over, time to go! \" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat -\n\"Petrificus Totalus! \"\nHarry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \"Crucio - Crucio - you can't dance forever, pretty-\" \n\"Impedimenta! \" yelled Harry. His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window -\n\"Harry, where did you come from? \" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape -\n\"Take that! \" shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor. \"Neville, are you - ? \"\n\"M'all right,\" muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \"Harry . . . Snape 'n' Malfoy . . . ran past. . . \"\n\"I know, I'm on it! \" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . . He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way?"

Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione's summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most . . . probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting . . . Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuri-ated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-takmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water's edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away. The staff were seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore wasand he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed. 'In there,' whispered Ginny in Harry's ear. And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry's neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore's passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round. Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore's body. A sharp pain rose in Harry's throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore's body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermione's laps. They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge . . . but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid's eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid \nwas heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-quee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonder-ful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again. A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore's body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. 'Nobility of spirit' . . . 'intel-lectual contribution' . . . 'greatness of heart' . . . it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore's idea of a few words: 'nitwit', 'oddment', 'blubber' and 'tweak 1, and again, had to suppress a grin . . . what was the matter with him? There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said . . . And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone . . . he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on . . . there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them \nstanding quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wiz-ards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remem-bered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated . . . And Harry saw very clearly as be sal there under the hot sun bow people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before. The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved. Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore's body and the table upon which it lay: higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested. There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs' tribute: he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise the mer-people sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view. Harry looked ai Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron's face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him. Hermione's face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry's gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say 'Be careful', or 'Don't do it', but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died. 'Ginny, listen . . . ' he said very quietly, as the buzz of con-versation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet. 'I can't be involved with you any more. We've got to stop seeing each other. We can't be together. ' \nShe said, with an oddly twisted smile, 'It's for some stupid, noble reason, isn't it? ' \n'It's been like . . . like something out of someone else's life, these last few weeks with you,' said Harry. 'But 1 can't . . . we can't . . . I've got things to do alone now. ' \nShe did not cry, she simply looked at him, \n'Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He's already used you as bait once, and that was just because you're my best friend's sister. Think how much danger you'll be in if we keep this up. He'll know, he'll find out. He'll try and get to me through you. ' \n'What if I don't care? ' said Ginny fiercely. 'I care,' said Harry. 'How do you think I'd feel if this was your funeral . . . and it was my fault . . . ' \nShe looked away from him, over the lake. T never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself. ' \n'Smart girl, that Hermione,' said Harry, trying to smile. 'I just wish I'd asked you sooner. We coukTve had ages . . . months . . . years maybe . . . ' \n'But you've been too busy saving the wizarding world,' said Ginny, half-laughing. 'Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much. ' \nHarry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore's tomb and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still: just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it . . . 'Harry! ' \nHe turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick. 'I've been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a little way with you? ' \n'No,' said Harry indifferently, and set off again. 'Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,' said Scrimgeour quietly, 'I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagree-ments, as you know, but no one knows better than 1 -' \n? What do you want? ' asked Harry flatly. Scrimgeour looked annoyed but, as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding. 'You are, of course, devastated,' he said. 'I know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favourite ever pupil. The bond between the two of you -' \n'What do you want? ' Harry repeated, coming to a halt. Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now. 'The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died. ' \n'Whose word? ' said Harry. 'Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the Tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there."
