I am Agent Smith. \\n[34]\\t\\t\\tI've been waiting for this noment. \\tFaster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a \\tjaw-breaking right. \\n[35]\\t\\t\\tYou can't win. \\tMorpheus smiles. \\n[36]\\t\\t\\tTake him. \\tCops swarm over Morpheus. \\n[37]\\t\\t\\tThe others were lost. \\n[38]\\t\\t\\tYou've taken care of Reagan? \\tAgent Jones nods. \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tThen the others do not matter. \\n[40]\\t\\t\\tThere is a problem. Reagan has \\t\\t\\tfailed to secure the hardware. \\tAgent Smith stares out the window. \\n[41]\\t\\t\\tNever send a human to do a \\t\\t\\tmachine's job. \\n[42]\\t\\t\\tBut if Reagan has failed, why \\t\\t\\thaven't they pulled the plug? \\n[43]\\t\\t\\tHaven't you learned by now, that \\t\\t\\tit is impossible to understand why \\t\\t\\tthey do the things they do? \\tHe turns. \\n[44]\\t\\t\\tContinue as planned. Trace his \\t\\t\\tsignal to locate their position \\t\\t\\tand deploy an extermination unit. \\tMorpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. \\tHe is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of \\tserum, alternately shivering and sweating. He is hooked \\tup to various monitors with white disk electrodes. \\tAgent Brown begins running a trace program. \\n[45]\\t\\t\\tHave you ever stood and stared at \\t\\t\\tit, Morpheus? Marveled at its \\t\\t\\tbeauty. Its genius. Billions of \\t\\t\\tpeople just living out their \\t\\t\\tlives. . . oblivious. \\tAgent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a \\thypodermic needle. \\n[46]\\t\\t\\tDid you know that the first Matrix \\t\\t\\twas designed to be a perfect human \\t\\t\\tworld? Where none suffered, where \\t\\t\\teveryone would be happy. It was a \\t\\t\\tdisaster. No one would accept the \\t\\t\\tprogram. Entire crops were lost. \\tAgent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and \\tplunges down. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tSome believed we lacked the \\t\\t\\tprogramming language to describe \\t\\t\\tyour perfect world. But I believe \\t\\t\\tthat, as a species, human beings \\t\\t\\tdefine their reality through \\t\\t\\tsuffering and misery. \\tAgent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react \\tviolently to the injection. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tThe perfect world was a dream that \\t\\t\\tyour primitive cerebrum kept \\t\\t\\ttrying to wake up from. Which is \\t\\t\\twhy the Matrix was re-designed to \\t\\t\\tthis:  the peak of your \\t\\t\\tcivilization. \\tHe turns from the window. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tI say 'your civilization' because \\t\\t\\tas soon as we start thinking for \\t\\t\\tyou, it really becomes our \\t\\t\\tcivilization, which is, of course, \\t\\t\\twhat this is all about. \\tHe sits down directly in front of Morpheus. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tEvolution, Morpheus. Evolution. \\tHe lifts Morpheus' head. \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tLike the dinosaur. Look out that \\t\\t\\twindow. You had your time. \\tMorpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the \\tpain racking his mind. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tThe future is our world, Morpheus."

                "text": "\\tThe standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion \\tgrow into panic. \\tNeo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly \\tseal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his \\tmouth is gone. \\tWild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents \\trestrain him holding him in the chair. \\n[18]\\t\\t\\tYou are going to help us, Mr. \\t\\t\\tAnderson, whether you want to or \\t\\t\\tnot. \\tSmith nods and the other two rip open his shirt. \\tFrom a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a \\tlong, fiber-optic wire tap. \\tNeo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over \\this exposed abdomen. Horrified, he watches as the \\telectronic device animates, become an organic creature \\tthat resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm. \\tThin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into \\tNeo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature \\twhich looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --  \\tBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it \\tworms its way inside. \\n[19]\\t\\t\\tDo we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? \\tCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his \\tteeth. \\n[20]\\t\\t\\tThen we have a deal? \\n[21]\\t\\t\\tWhatever you want, Mr. Reagan. \\tCypher takes a deep drink of wine. \\n[22]\\t\\t\\tAccess codes to Zion. \\n[23]\\t\\t\\tMorpheus. \\n[24]\\t\\t\\tEighth floor. They're on the \\t\\t\\teighth floor. \\n[25]\\t\\t\\tAre orders that hard to follow? \\t\\t\\tI'll say it again. Morpheus must \\t\\t\\tbe taken alive. Understand? \\n[26]\\t\\t\\tHow like a rodent. \\n[27]\\t\\t\\tWe have them now. \\n[28]\\t\\t\\tSo, we meet at last. \\n[29]\\t\\t\\tSmith. I am Agent Smith. \\n[30]\\t\\t\\tI've been waiting for this noment. \\tFaster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a \\tjaw-breaking right. \\n[31]\\t\\t\\tYou can't win. \\tMorpheus smiles. \\n[32]\\t\\t\\tTake him. \\tCops swarm over Morpheus. \\n[33]\\t\\t\\tYou've taken care of Reagan? \\tAgent Jones nods. \\n[34]\\t\\t\\tThen the others do not matter. \\n[35]\\t\\t\\tNever send a human to do a \\t\\t\\tmachine's job. \\n[36]\\t\\t\\tHaven't you learned by now, that \\t\\t\\tit is impossible to understand why \\t\\t\\tthey do the things they do? \\tHe turns. \\n[37]\\t\\t\\tContinue as planned. Trace his \\t\\t\\tsignal to locate their position \\t\\t\\tand deploy an extermination unit. \\tMorpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. \\tHe is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of \\tserum, alternately shivering and sweating. He is hooked \\tup to various monitors with white disk electrodes. \\tAgent Brown begins running a trace program. \\n[38]\\t\\t\\tHave you ever stood and stared at \\t\\t\\tit, Morpheus? Marveled at its \\t\\t\\tbeauty. Its genius. Billions of \\t\\t\\tpeople just living out their \\t\\t\\tlives. . . oblivious. \\tAgent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a \\thypodermic needle. \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tDid you know that the first Matrix \\t\\t\\twas designed to be a perfect human \\t\\t\\tworld? Where none suffered, where \\t\\t\\teveryone would be happy. It was a \\t\\t\\tdisaster. No one would accept the \\t\\t\\tprogram. Entire crops were lost. \\tAgent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and \\tplunges down. \\n[40]\\t\\t\\tSome believed we lacked the \\t\\t\\tprogramming language to describe \\t\\t\\tyour perfect world. But I believe \\t\\t\\tthat, as a species, human beings \\t\\t\\tdefine their reality through \\t\\t\\tsuffering and misery. \\tAgent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react \\tviolently to the injection. \\n[41]\\t\\t\\tThe perfect world was a dream that \\t\\t\\tyour primitive cerebrum kept \\t\\t\\ttrying to wake up from. Which is \\t\\t\\twhy the Matrix was re-designed to \\t\\t\\tthis:  the peak of your \\t\\t\\tcivilization. \\tHe turns from the window. \\n[42]\\t\\t\\tI say 'your civilization' because \\t\\t\\tas soon as we start thinking for \\t\\t\\tyou, it really becomes our \\t\\t\\tcivilization, which is, of course, \\t\\t\\twhat this is all about. \\tHe sits down directly in front of Morpheus. \\n[43]\\t\\t\\tEvolution, Morpheus. Evolution. \\tHe lifts Morpheus' head. \\n[44]\\t\\t\\tLike the dinosaur. Look out that \\t\\t\\twindow. You had your time. \\tMorpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the \\tpain racking his mind. \\n[45]\\t\\t\\tThe future is our world, Morpheus. \\t\\t\\tThe future is our time. \\n[46]\\t\\t\\tI'd like to share a revelation \\t\\t\\tthat I've had during my time here. \\t\\t\\tIt came to me when I tried to \\t\\t\\tclassify your species. I've \\t\\t\\trealized that you are not actually \\t\\t\\tmammals. \\tThe life signs continue their chaotic patterns. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tEvery mammal on this planet \\t\\t\\tinstinctively develops a natural \\t\\t\\tequilibrium with the surrounding \\t\\t\\tenvironment. But you humans do \\t\\t\\tnot. You move to an area and you \\t\\t\\tmultiply and multiply until every \\t\\t\\tnatural resource is consumed and \\t\\t\\tthe only way you can survive is to \\t\\t\\tspread to another area. \\tHe leans forward. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tThere is another organism on this \\t\\t\\tplanet that follows the same \\t\\t\\tpattern. Do you know what it is? \\t\\t\\tA virus. \\tHe smiles. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tHuman beings are a disease, a \\t\\t\\tcancer of this planet. You are a \\t\\t\\tplague. And we are. . . the cure. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tWhy isn't the serum working? \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tOf course he knows. He's \\t\\t\\tresisting. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tI don't know. If I knew. . . \\tAgent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming \\tangry. It is something that isn't supposed to happen to \\tagents. \\n[53]\\t\\t\\tLeave me with him. \\tAgent Brown and Jones look at each other. \\n[54]\\t\\t\\tNow! \\n[55]\\t\\t\\tCan you hear me, Morpheus? I'm \\t\\t\\tgoing to be honest with you. \\tHe removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his \\tshoulder. \\n[56]\\t\\t\\tI hate this place. This zoo. \\t\\t\\tThis prison. This reality, \\t\\t\\twhatever you want to call it, I \\t\\t\\tcan't stand it any longer. It's \\t\\t\\tthe smell, if there is such a \\t\\t\\tthing. I feel saturated by it. I \\t\\t\\tcan taste your stink and every \\t\\t\\ttime I do, I fear that I've \\t\\t\\tsomehow been infected by it. \\tHe wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips \\tof his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose. \\n[57]\\t\\t\\tRepulsive, isn't it? \\tHe lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both \\thands. \\n[58]\\t\\t\\tI must get out of here, I must get \\t\\t\\tfree. In this mind is tlie key. \\t\\t\\tMy key. \\tMorpheus sneers through his pain. \\n[59]\\t\\t\\tOnce Zion is gone, there's no \\t\\t\\tneed for me to be here. Do you \\t\\t\\tunderstand? I need the codes. I \\t\\t\\thave to get inside Zion. You have \\t\\t\\tto tell me how. \\tHe begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh. \\n[60]\\t\\t\\tTell me! Tell me! \\tThe skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown \\tburst into the room. Agent Smith releases Morpheus. \\n[61]\\t\\t\\tKnow what? \\tAgent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what \\the is hearing. \\n[62]\\t\\t\\tFind them and destroy them! \\tAgent Jones nods and touches his ear piece. \\n[63]\\t\\t\\tNo. \\tThe GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a \\tcacophony of CRASHING GLASS --  \\tAs the Agents go for their weapons. \\tBut Neo is too close, the . 50 CALIBER too fast and \\tBULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room. \\tAgent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, \\tblood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --  \\tThen Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls. \\tAnd finally Agent Jones. \\tNeo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action. \\n[64]\\t\\t\\tNooo! \\tHe FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a \\tperfect line. \\tFor an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the \\tWALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of \\tchalk. \\tAnd as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet \\tburies itself in his leg --  \\tKnocking him off balance. \\n[65]\\t\\t\\tThey're not out yet. \\n[66]\\t\\t\\tYou're empty. \\tNeo pulls the TRIGGER. CLICK. \\n[67]\\t\\t\\tYou can't win. \\n[68]\\t\\t\\tDo you hear that, Mr. Anderson? \\tAgent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to \\tlook down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a \\thole in the darkness. \\n[69]\\t\\t\\tThat is the sound of \\t\\t\\tinevitability. \\tNeo sees it coming and he starts to fight. \\n[70]\\t\\t\\tIt is the sound of your death. \\tThere is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as \\tAgent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe. \\n[71]\\t\\t\\tGoodbye, Mr. Anderson. \\tThe TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words. \\tThe veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the \\tpain. \\tHe is not ready to die. \\n[72]\\t\\t\\tCheck him. \\n[73]\\t\\t\\tI told you, you couldn't win."

Hanging onto the \\tframe, he steps onto the small ledge. \\tThe scaffold seems even farther away. \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tI'm going to die. \\tThe WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, \\tknocking Neo off balance.

His stomach looks fine. He starts to take a \\tdeep, everything-is-okay breath, when --  \\tThe PHONE RINGS. \\tIt almost stops his heart. It CONTINUES RINGING, \\tbuilding pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, \\tsucking him in with an almost gravitational force. \\tHe answers it, saying nothing. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tThe agents --  \\n[48]\\t\\t\\t. . . Yes. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tWhat are you doing? \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tWhat are you doing? \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tJesus! God! \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tDo what? \\tThe instant he hears the word, he knows. \\n[53]\\t\\t\\tOh, shit --  \\tThe cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his \\tchest. Gizmo wrestles with the bug. \\n[54]\\t\\t\\tIt's an honor. \\n[55]\\t\\t\\tYou could say that. \\n[56]\\t\\t\\tYou're Morpheus, you're a legend. \\t\\t\\tMost hackers would die to meet \\t\\t\\tyou. \\n[57]\\t\\t\\tNo. \\n[58]\\t\\t\\tBecause I don't like the idea that \\t\\t\\tI'm not in control of my life. \\n[59]\\t\\t\\tWhat gift? \\n[60]\\t\\t\\tIt's not magic. \\n[61]\\t\\t\\tFree from what? \\n[62]\\t\\t\\tWhat truth? \\n[63]\\t\\t\\tHow? \\n[64]\\t\\t\\tApoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen \\t\\t\\tVirus. \\n[65]\\t\\t\\tA little. \\n[66]\\t\\t\\tEssentially, it's a hardware \\t\\t\\tsystem that uses an apparatus; \\t\\t\\theadgear, gloves and whatever to \\t\\t\\tmake you feel that you are in a \\t\\t\\tcomputer program. \\n[67]\\t\\t\\tYou might not, no. \\n[68]\\t\\t\\tYou did all this? \\tShe nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. \\tThey are wired to an old hotel phone. \\n[69]\\t\\t\\tShit. . . \\tCypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent \\tdata. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs. \\tNeo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers \\tdisappear beneath the rippling surface. \\tQuickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror \\tstretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy \\tstuck to his fingertips. \\n[70]\\t\\t\\tWhat is this? Mescaline? \\n[71]\\t\\t\\tUh-oh. . . \\n[72]\\t\\t\\tIt's cold. \\tThe mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, \\ttipping his head as though he were sinking into the \\tmirror, trying to keep his mouth up. \\n[73]\\t\\t\\tIt's all over me --  \\tMorpheus is right next to him, with the phone. \\n[74] \\tNeo's eyes flutter open. We see Trinity's face above us, \\tangelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick. \\n[75] \\n[76]\\t\\t\\t. . . am I dead? \\n[77] \\tHe opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. \\tHe focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of \\tacupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device."

Horrified, he watches as the \\telectronic device animates, become an organic creature \\tthat resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm. \\tThin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into \\tNeo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature \\twhich looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --  \\tBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it \\tworms its way inside. \\n[19]\\t\\t\\tDo we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? \\tCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his \\tteeth. \\n[20]\\t\\t\\tThen we have a deal? \\n[21]\\t\\t\\tWhatever you want, Mr. Reagan. \\tCypher takes a deep drink of wine. \\n[22]\\t\\t\\tAccess codes to Zion. \\n[23]\\t\\t\\tMorpheus. \\n[24]\\t\\t\\tEighth floor.

Trace his \\t\\t\\tsignal to locate their position \\t\\t\\tand deploy an extermination unit. \\tMorpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. \\tHe is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of \\tserum, alternately shivering and sweating. He is hooked \\tup to various monitors with white disk electrodes. \\tAgent Brown begins running a trace program. \\n[38]\\t\\t\\tHave you ever stood and stared at \\t\\t\\tit, Morpheus? Marveled at its \\t\\t\\tbeauty. Its genius. Billions of \\t\\t\\tpeople just living out their \\t\\t\\tlives. . . oblivious. \\tAgent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a \\thypodermic needle. \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tDid you know that the first Matrix \\t\\t\\twas designed to be a perfect human \\t\\t\\tworld? Where none suffered, where \\t\\t\\teveryone would be happy. It was a \\t\\t\\tdisaster. No one would accept the \\t\\t\\tprogram. Entire crops were lost. \\tAgent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and \\tplunges down. \\n[40]\\t\\t\\tSome believed we lacked the \\t\\t\\tprogramming language to describe \\t\\t\\tyour perfect world. But I believe \\t\\t\\tthat, as a species, human beings \\t\\t\\tdefine their reality through \\t\\t\\tsuffering and misery. \\tAgent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react \\tviolently to the injection. \\n[41]\\t\\t\\tThe perfect world was a dream that \\t\\t\\tyour primitive cerebrum kept \\t\\t\\ttrying to wake up from. Which is \\t\\t\\twhy the Matrix was re-designed to \\t\\t\\tthis:  the peak of your \\t\\t\\tcivilization. \\tHe turns from the window. \\n[42]\\t\\t\\tI say 'your civilization' because \\t\\t\\tas soon as we start thinking for \\t\\t\\tyou, it really becomes our \\t\\t\\tcivilization, which is, of course, \\t\\t\\twhat this is all about. \\tHe sits down directly in front of Morpheus. \\n[43]\\t\\t\\tEvolution, Morpheus. Evolution. \\tHe lifts Morpheus' head. \\n[44]\\t\\t\\tLike the dinosaur. Look out that \\t\\t\\twindow.

I've \\t\\t\\trealized that you are not actually \\t\\t\\tmammals. \\tThe life signs continue their chaotic patterns. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tEvery mammal on this planet \\t\\t\\tinstinctively develops a natural \\t\\t\\tequilibrium with the surrounding \\t\\t\\tenvironment. But you humans do \\t\\t\\tnot. You move to an area and you \\t\\t\\tmultiply and multiply until every \\t\\t\\tnatural resource is consumed and \\t\\t\\tthe only way you can survive is to \\t\\t\\tspread to another area. \\tHe leans forward. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tThere is another organism on this \\t\\t\\tplanet that follows the same \\t\\t\\tpattern. Do you know what it is? \\t\\t\\tA virus. \\tHe smiles. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tHuman beings are a disease, a \\t\\t\\tcancer of this planet. You are a \\t\\t\\tplague. And we are. . . the cure. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tWhy isn't the serum working? \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tOf course he knows. He's \\t\\t\\tresisting. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tI don't know. If I knew. . . \\tAgent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming \\tangry.

I've been \\t\\t\\twanting to meet you for some time. \\n[17]\\t\\t\\tMy name is Trinity. \\n[18]\\t\\t\\tThat was a long time ago. \\n[19]\\t\\t\\tWhat? \\n[20]\\t\\t\\tMost guys do. \\tNeo is a little embarrassed. \\n[21]\\t\\t\\tNo. It's safe here and I don't \\t\\t\\thave much time. \\tThe MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking \\tdirectly into each other's ear. \\n[22]\\t\\t\\tI had to gamble that you would see \\t\\t\\tand they wouldn't. \\n[23]\\t\\t\\tI can't explain everything to you. \\t\\t\\tI'm sure that it's all going to \\t\\t\\tseem very strange, but I brought \\t\\t\\tyou here to warn you, Neo. You \\t\\t\\tare in a lot of danger. \\n[24]\\t\\t\\tThey're watching you. Something \\t\\t\\thappened and they found out about \\t\\t\\tyou. Normally, if our target is \\t\\t\\texposed we let it go. But this \\t\\t\\ttime, we can't do that. \\n[25]\\t\\t\\tYou came here because you wanted \\t\\t\\tto know the answer to a hacker's \\t\\t\\tquestion. \\n[26]\\t\\t\\tTwelve years ago I met a man, a \\t\\t\\tgreat man, who said that no one \\t\\t\\tcould be told the answer to that \\t\\t\\tquestion. That they had to see \\t\\t\\tit, to believe it. \\tHer body is against his; her lips very close to his ear. \\n[27]\\t\\t\\tHe told me that no one should look \\t\\t\\tfor the answer unless they have to \\t\\t\\tbecause once you see it, \\t\\t\\teverything changes. Your life and \\t\\t\\tthe world you live in will never \\t\\t\\tbe the same."

With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of \\tTORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the \\tstation. \\tNeo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the \\tescalator --  \\tAs the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last \\tcar open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his \\tglasses again intact. \\n[186]\\t\\t\\tMr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out \\t\\t\\tof here! \\n[187]\\t\\t\\tHurry, Tank!

Seen from inside. \\n[192]\\t\\t\\tI've decided to make a few \\t\\t\\tchanges. \\tWe SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone. \\tHe steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, \\twearing a long black coat and dark glasses.

A cop is sent to \\tsearch the bathroom. \\tMorpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear. \\n[17]\\t\\t\\tA little longer. . . \\tBrown is talking to the tall employee. \\n[18]\\t\\t\\tWhen I tell you, go to the end of \\t\\t\\tthe row to the first office on the \\t\\t\\tleft, stay. as low as you can. \\tSweat trickles down his forehead. \\n[19]\\t\\t\\tNow. \\tNeo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he \\tfreezes right behind a cop who has just turned around. \\tStaying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING \\tacross the opening to the first office on the left. \\tThe room is empty. \\n[20]\\t\\t\\tGood. Now there is a window. \\t\\t\\tOpen it. \\n[21]\\t\\t\\tThe answer is coming, Neo. \\tHe opens the window. The window howls into the room. \\n[22]\\t\\t\\tOutside, there's a scaffold. You \\t\\t\\tcan use it to get to the roof. \\tLeaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is \\tseveral offices away. \\n[23]\\t\\t\\tThere's a small ledge. It's a \\t\\t\\tshort climb. You can make it. \\tNeo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a \\tconcrete chasm. \\n[24]\\t\\t\\tDon't be controlled by your fear, \\t\\t\\tNeo. There are only two ways out \\t\\t\\tof this building. One is that \\t\\t\\tscaffold. The other is in their \\t\\t\\tcustody. You take a chance either \\t\\t\\tway. I leave it to you. \\tCLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at \\tthe scaffold. \\n[25]\\t\\t\\tThis line is tapped, so I must be \\t\\t\\tbrief. \\n[26]\\t\\t\\tThey got to you first, but they've \\t\\t\\tunderestimated how important you \\t\\t\\tare. If they knew what I know, \\t\\t\\tyou would probably be dead. \\tNeo feels sick. \\n[27]\\t\\t\\tI don't know what you are thinking \\t\\t\\tright now but I want you to \\t\\t\\tunderstand that I will not give up \\t\\t\\ton you until you give up on me. \\tNeo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara. \\n[28]\\t\\t\\tDo you still want to meet? \\n[29]\\t\\t\\tTake the Howard line south. \\tCLICK. He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done. \\n[30]\\t\\t\\tAt last. \\tHe wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible \\tbehind circular mirrored glasses. \\tHe strides to Neo and they shake hands. \\n[31]\\t\\t\\tWelcome, Neo. As you no doubt \\t\\t\\thave guessed, I am Morpheus. \\n[32]\\t\\t\\tPlease. Come. Sit. \\tHe nods to Trinity. \\n[33]\\t\\t\\tThank you, Trinity. \\tShe bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an \\tadjacent room. \\tThey sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- \\tleather chairs. \\n[34]\\t\\t\\tI imagine, right now, you must be \\t\\t\\tfeeling a bit like Alice, tumbling \\t\\t\\tdown the rabbit hole? \\n[35]\\t\\t\\tI can see it in your eyes. You \\t\\t\\thave the look of a man who accepts \\t\\t\\twhat he sees because he is \\t\\t\\texpecting to wake up. \\tA smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips. \\n[36]\\t\\t\\tIronically, this is not far from \\t\\t\\tthe truth. But I'm getting ahead \\t\\t\\tof myself. Can you tell me, Neo, \\t\\t\\twhy are you here? \\n[37]\\t\\t\\tYes. Thank you. But I think we \\t\\t\\tboth know there's more to it than \\t\\t\\tthat. Do you believe in fate, Neo? \\n[38]\\t\\t\\tWhy not? \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tI know exactly what you mean. \\tAgain, that smile that could cut glass. \\n[40]\\t\\t\\tLet me tell you why you are here. \\t\\t\\tYou are here because you have the \\t\\t\\tgift. \\n[41]\\t\\t\\tI've watched you, Neo. You do not \\t\\t\\tuse a computer like a tool. You \\t\\t\\tuse it like it was part of \\t\\t\\tyourself. What you can do inside \\t\\t\\ta computer is not normal. I know. \\t\\t\\tI've seen it. What you do is \\t\\t\\tmagic. \\tNeo shrugs. \\n[42]\\t\\t\\tBut it is, Neo. It is. How else \\t\\t\\twould you describe what has been \\t\\t\\thappening to you? \\tHe leans forward. \\n[43]\\t\\t\\tWe are trained in this world to \\t\\t\\taccept only what is rational and \\t\\t\\tlogical. Have you ever wondered \\t\\t\\twhy? \\tNeo shakes his head. \\n[44]\\t\\t\\tAs children, we do not separate \\t\\t\\tthe possible from the impossible \\t\\t\\twhich is why the younger a mind is \\t\\t\\tthe easier it is to free while a \\t\\t\\tmind like yours can be very \\t\\t\\tdifficult. \\n[45]\\t\\t\\tFrom the Matrix. \\tNeo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of \\thimself. \\n[46]\\t\\t\\tDo you want to know what it is, \\t\\t\\tNeo? \\tNeo swallows and nods his head. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tIt's that feeling you have had all \\t\\t\\tyour life. That feeling that \\t\\t\\tsomething was wrong with the \\t\\t\\tworld. You don't know what it is \\t\\t\\tbut it's there, like a splinter in \\t\\t\\tyour mind, driving you mad, \\t\\t\\tdriving you to me. But what is \\t\\t\\tit? \\tThe LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tThe Matrix is everywhere, it's all \\t\\t\\taround us, here even in this room. \\t\\t\\tYou can see it out your window, or \\t\\t\\ton your television. You feel it \\t\\t\\twhen you go to work, or go to \\t\\t\\tchurch or pay your taxes. It is \\t\\t\\tthe world that has been pulled \\t\\t\\tover your eyes to blind you from \\t\\t\\tthe truth. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tThat you are a slave, Neo. That \\t\\t\\tyou, like everyone else, was born \\t\\t\\tinto bondage. . . \\t\\t\\t. . . kept inside a prison that you \\t\\t\\tcannot smell, taste, or touch. A \\t\\t\\tprison for your mind. \\tOutside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, no one can be told \\t\\t\\twhat the Matrix is. You have to \\t\\t\\tsee it for yourself. \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tHold out your hands. \\tIn Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tThis is your last chance. After \\t\\t\\tthis, there is no going back. \\tIn his left, a blue pill. \\n[53]\\t\\t\\tYou take the blue pill and the \\t\\t\\tstory ends. You wake in your bed \\t\\t\\tand you believe whatever you want \\t\\t\\tto believe. \\tThe pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses. \\n[54]\\t\\t\\tYou take the red pill and you stay \\t\\t\\tin Wonderland and I show you how \\t\\t\\tdeep the rabbit-hole goes. \\tNeo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the \\tmoisture growing in his palms. \\n[55]\\t\\t\\tRemember that all I am offering is \\t\\t\\tthe truth. Nothing more. \\tNeo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The \\tCheshire smile returns. \\n[56]\\t\\t\\tFollow me. \\tHe leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with \\thigh-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green \\tfrom the racks of monitors. \\tTrinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter. \\n[57]\\t\\t\\tHaven't I always told you, Cypher, \\t\\t\\tnot to let fear control your life. \\t\\t\\tApoc, are we on-line? \\tNeo recognizes the large man from the El train. \\n[58]\\t\\t\\tNeo, time is always against us. \\t\\t\\tWill you take a seat there? \\tIn the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair \\tis an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. \\n[59]\\t\\t\\tI imagine you know sonething about \\t\\t\\tvirtual reality. \\tNeo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode \\tdisks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck. \\n[60]\\t\\t\\tTell me about it. \\n[61]\\t\\t\\tIf the virtual reality apparatus, \\t\\t\\tas you called it, was wired to all \\t\\t\\tof your senses and controlled them \\t\\t\\tcompletely, would you be able to \\t\\t\\ttell the difference between the \\t\\t\\tvirtual world and the real world? \\n[62]\\t\\t\\tNo, you wouldn't. \\tNeo whispers to Trinity. \\n[63]\\t\\t\\tThe pill you took is part of a \\t\\t\\ttrace program. It's going to make \\t\\t\\tthings feel a bit strange. \\tDistantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING \\ton a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and \\ttwitch when he notices the mirror. \\tWide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a \\twebwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the \\tmirror were becoming liquid. \\n[64]\\t\\t\\tJust relax, Neo. \\tThe strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, \\tuntil the fragile wisps of mirror thread break. \\tWith the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes \\tof electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and \\tfade. \\tHe looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored \\ticicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running \\tlike wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms \\twhere he sees his face reflected. \\n[65]\\t\\t\\tApoc? \\n[66]\\t\\t\\tTank, we're going to need the \\t\\t\\tsignal soon. Stay calm, Neo. \\tThe mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up \\this arns like hundreds of insects. \\n[67]\\t\\t\\tShit! Apoc? \\tStreams of mercury run from Neo's nose. \\n[68]\\t\\t\\tNow, Tank now!"

Call the chop-shop. \\tShe hangs up. \\n[33]\\t\\t\\tListen to me, Neo.

We got it. \\tHanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire- \\ttap. \\n[46]\\t\\t\\tThanks for your help, Gizmo. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tGizmo, you don't have the hardware \\t\\t\\tto handle this software. \\tHe howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away. \\tTrinity turns to Neo. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tLet's go. He's waiting. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tThis is it. \\tNeo can hear his own heart pounding. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tLet me give one piece of advice. \\t\\t\\tBe honest. He knows more than you \\t\\t\\tcan possibly imagine. \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tI knew he would. \\tCypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone \\taway from, Neo. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tIt's going into replication. \\n[53]\\t\\t\\tI got a fibrillation! \\n[54]\\t\\t\\tHe's going into arrest! \\n[55]\\t\\t\\tFar from it."

And I'm not \\t\\t\\tsure what they're going to do. \\n[8]\\t\\t\\tStand up and see for yourself. \\n[9]\\t\\t\\tYes. Now. \\tNeo starts to stand. \\n[10]\\t\\t\\tDo it slowly. Slowly. The elevator. \\tHis head slowly peeks up over the partition. \\tAt the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones \\tleading a group of cops. A female employee turns and \\tpoints out Neo's cubicle. \\tNeo ducks. \\n[11]\\t\\t\\tYes. \\tOne cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the \\tagents. \\n[12]\\t\\t\\tI'm not sure. But, if you don't \\t\\t\\twant to find out, you better get \\t\\t\\tout of there. \\n[13]\\t\\t\\tI can guide you out, but you have \\t\\t\\tto do exactly what I say. \\tThe agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle. \\n[14]\\t\\t\\tThe cubicle across from you is \\t\\t\\tempty. \\n[15]\\t\\t\\tGo! Now! \\tNeo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle \\tjust as the agents turn into his row. \\tNeo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone \\ttightly to him. \\n[16]\\t\\t\\tStay here for a moment. \\tThe agents enter Neo's empty cubicle. A cop is sent to \\tsearch the bathroom. \\tMorpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear. \\n[17]\\t\\t\\tA little longer. . . \\tBrown is talking to the tall employee. \\n[18]\\t\\t\\tWhen I tell you, go to the end of \\t\\t\\tthe row to the first office on the \\t\\t\\tleft, stay. as low as you can. \\tSweat trickles down his forehead. \\n[19]\\t\\t\\tNow. \\tNeo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he \\tfreezes right behind a cop who has just turned around. \\tStaying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING \\tacross the opening to the first office on the left. \\tThe room is empty. \\n[20]\\t\\t\\tGood. Now there is a window. \\t\\t\\tOpen it. \\n[21]\\t\\t\\tThe answer is coming, Neo. \\tHe opens the window. The window howls into the room. \\n[22]\\t\\t\\tOutside, there's a scaffold. You \\t\\t\\tcan use it to get to the roof. \\tLeaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is \\tseveral offices away. \\n[23]\\t\\t\\tThere's a small ledge. It's a \\t\\t\\tshort climb. You can make it. \\tNeo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a \\tconcrete chasm. \\n[24]\\t\\t\\tDon't be controlled by your fear, \\t\\t\\tNeo. There are only two ways out \\t\\t\\tof this building. One is that \\t\\t\\tscaffold. The other is in their \\t\\t\\tcustody. You take a chance either \\t\\t\\tway. I leave it to you. \\tCLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at \\tthe scaffold. \\n[25]\\t\\t\\tThis line is tapped, so I must be \\t\\t\\tbrief. \\n[26]\\t\\t\\tThey got to you first, but they've \\t\\t\\tunderestimated how important you \\t\\t\\tare. If they knew what I know, \\t\\t\\tyou would probably be dead. \\tNeo feels sick. \\n[27]\\t\\t\\tI don't know what you are thinking \\t\\t\\tright now but I want you to \\t\\t\\tunderstand that I will not give up \\t\\t\\ton you until you give up on me. \\tNeo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara. \\n[28]\\t\\t\\tDo you still want to meet? \\n[29]\\t\\t\\tTake the Howard line south. \\tCLICK. He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done. \\n[30]\\t\\t\\tAt last. \\tHe wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible \\tbehind circular mirrored glasses. \\tHe strides to Neo and they shake hands. \\n[31]\\t\\t\\tWelcome, Neo. As you no doubt \\t\\t\\thave guessed, I am Morpheus. \\n[32]\\t\\t\\tPlease. Come. Sit. \\tHe nods to Trinity. \\n[33]\\t\\t\\tThank you, Trinity. \\tShe bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an \\tadjacent room. \\tThey sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- \\tleather chairs."

But I'm getting ahead \\t\\t\\tof myself. Can you tell me, Neo, \\t\\t\\twhy are you here? \\n[37]\\t\\t\\tYes. Thank you. But I think we \\t\\t\\tboth know there's more to it than \\t\\t\\tthat. Do you believe in fate, Neo? \\n[38]\\t\\t\\tWhy not? \\n[39]\\t\\t\\tI know exactly what you mean. \\tAgain, that smile that could cut glass. \\n[40]\\t\\t\\tLet me tell you why you are here. \\t\\t\\tYou are here because you have the \\t\\t\\tgift. \\n[41]\\t\\t\\tI've watched you, Neo. You do not \\t\\t\\tuse a computer like a tool. You \\t\\t\\tuse it like it was part of \\t\\t\\tyourself. What you can do inside \\t\\t\\ta computer is not normal. I know. \\t\\t\\tI've seen it. What you do is \\t\\t\\tmagic. \\tNeo shrugs. \\n[42]\\t\\t\\tBut it is, Neo. It is. How else \\t\\t\\twould you describe what has been \\t\\t\\thappening to you? \\tHe leans forward. \\n[43]\\t\\t\\tWe are trained in this world to \\t\\t\\taccept only what is rational and \\t\\t\\tlogical. Have you ever wondered \\t\\t\\twhy? \\tNeo shakes his head. \\n[44]\\t\\t\\tAs children, we do not separate \\t\\t\\tthe possible from the impossible \\t\\t\\twhich is why the younger a mind is \\t\\t\\tthe easier it is to free while a \\t\\t\\tmind like yours can be very \\t\\t\\tdifficult. \\n[45]\\t\\t\\tFrom the Matrix. \\tNeo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of \\thimself. \\n[46]\\t\\t\\tDo you want to know what it is, \\t\\t\\tNeo? \\tNeo swallows and nods his head. \\n[47]\\t\\t\\tIt's that feeling you have had all \\t\\t\\tyour life. That feeling that \\t\\t\\tsomething was wrong with the \\t\\t\\tworld. You don't know what it is \\t\\t\\tbut it's there, like a splinter in \\t\\t\\tyour mind, driving you mad, \\t\\t\\tdriving you to me. But what is \\t\\t\\tit? \\tThe LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back. \\n[48]\\t\\t\\tThe Matrix is everywhere, it's all \\t\\t\\taround us, here even in this room. \\t\\t\\tYou can see it out your window, or \\t\\t\\ton your television. You feel it \\t\\t\\twhen you go to work, or go to \\t\\t\\tchurch or pay your taxes. It is \\t\\t\\tthe world that has been pulled \\t\\t\\tover your eyes to blind you from \\t\\t\\tthe truth. \\n[49]\\t\\t\\tThat you are a slave, Neo. That \\t\\t\\tyou, like everyone else, was born \\t\\t\\tinto bondage. . . \\t\\t\\t. . . kept inside a prison that you \\t\\t\\tcannot smell, taste, or touch. A \\t\\t\\tprison for your mind. \\tOutside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass. \\n[50]\\t\\t\\tUnfortunately, no one can be told \\t\\t\\twhat the Matrix is. You have to \\t\\t\\tsee it for yourself. \\n[51]\\t\\t\\tHold out your hands. \\tIn Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill. \\n[52]\\t\\t\\tThis is your last chance. After \\t\\t\\tthis, there is no going back. \\tIn his left, a blue pill. \\n[53]\\t\\t\\tYou take the blue pill and the \\t\\t\\tstory ends. You wake in your bed \\t\\t\\tand you believe whatever you want \\t\\t\\tto believe. \\tThe pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses. \\n[54]\\t\\t\\tYou take the red pill and you stay \\t\\t\\tin Wonderland and I show you how \\t\\t\\tdeep the rabbit-hole goes. \\tNeo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the \\tmoisture growing in his palms. \\n[55]\\t\\t\\tRemember that all I am offering is \\t\\t\\tthe truth. Nothing more. \\tNeo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The \\tCheshire smile returns. \\n[56]\\t\\t\\tFollow me. \\tHe leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with \\thigh-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green \\tfrom the racks of monitors. \\tTrinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter. \\n[57]\\t\\t\\tHaven't I always told you, Cypher, \\t\\t\\tnot to let fear control your life. \\t\\t\\tApoc, are we on-line? \\tNeo recognizes the large man from the El train. \\n[58]\\t\\t\\tNeo, time is always against us. \\t\\t\\tWill you take a seat there? \\tIn the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair \\tis an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. \\n[59]\\t\\t\\tI imagine you know sonething about \\t\\t\\tvirtual reality. \\tNeo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode \\tdisks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck. \\n[60]\\t\\t\\tTell me about it. \\n[61]\\t\\t\\tIf the virtual reality apparatus, \\t\\t\\tas you called it, was wired to all \\t\\t\\tof your senses and controlled them \\t\\t\\tcompletely, would you be able to \\t\\t\\ttell the difference between the \\t\\t\\tvirtual world and the real world? \\n[62]\\t\\t\\tNo, you wouldn't. \\tNeo whispers to Trinity. \\n[63]\\t\\t\\tThe pill you took is part of a \\t\\t\\ttrace program. It's going to make \\t\\t\\tthings feel a bit strange. \\tDistantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING \\ton a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and \\ttwitch when he notices the mirror. \\tWide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a \\twebwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the \\tmirror were becoming liquid. \\n[64]\\t\\t\\tJust relax, Neo. \\tThe strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, \\tuntil the fragile wisps of mirror thread break. \\tWith the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes \\tof electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and \\tfade. \\tHe looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored \\ticicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running \\tlike wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms \\twhere he sees his face reflected. \\n[65]\\t\\t\\tApoc? \\n[66]\\t\\t\\tTank, we're going to need the \\t\\t\\tsignal soon.

The \\tearth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out \\tbeneath us as we ENTER the television. \\n[94]\\t\\t\\t'The desert of the real.

The only place \\t\\t\\thumans can survive outside the \\t\\t\\tMatrix is underground. \\tStill MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the \\tchairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. \\tDizzy, Neo holds onto the chair. \\n[96]\\t\\t\\tIt started early in the twenty- \\t\\t\\tfirst century, with the birth of \\t\\t\\tartificial intelligence, a \\t\\t\\tsingular consciousness that \\t\\t\\tspawned an entire race of \\t\\t\\tmachines. \\tIn his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather. \\n[97]\\t\\t\\tAt first all they wanted was to be \\t\\t\\ttreated as equals, entitled to the \\t\\t\\tsame human inalienable rights. \\t\\t\\tWhatever they were given, it was \\t\\t\\tnot enough. \\tIn the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light \\tup a bloody battle field. \\n[98]\\t\\t\\tWe don't know who struck first. \\t\\t\\tUs or them. But sometime at the \\t\\t\\tend of the twenty-first century \\t\\t\\tthe battle was joined. \\tWe MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us."

They have an organic \\tarchitecture like a microbiotic organism, that is \\tperpetually in motion. \\tThe Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, \\tsplitting open the soft, stearing meat inside. \\n[100]\\t\\t\\tIt scorched and burned the sky. \\t\\t\\tWithout the sun, the machines \\t\\t\\tsought out a new energy source to \\t\\t\\tsurvive. \\tThe Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink \\tbursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud \\tof stain. \\n[101]\\t\\t\\tThey discovered a new form of \\t\\t\\tfusion. All that was required to \\t\\t\\tinitiate the reaction was a small \\t\\t\\telectric charge. Throughout human \\t\\t\\thistory we have been dependent on \\t\\t\\tmachines to survive. Fate, it \\t\\t\\tseems, is not without a sense of \\t\\t\\tirony. \\tWe return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where \\twe see human beings looking almost blissful in their \\tgelatin cocoons. \\n[102]\\t\\t\\tThe human body generates more bio- \\t\\t\\telectricity than a 120-volt \\t\\t\\tbattery and over 25,000 B. T. U. 's \\t\\t\\tof body heat. \\tOutside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a \\tbreathing greenhouse, are the growing fields. \\n[103]\\t\\t\\tWe are, as an energy source, \\t\\t\\teasily renewable and completely \\t\\t\\trecyclable, the dead liquified and \\t\\t\\tfed intravenously to the living. \\tHuge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop. \\n[104]\\t\\t\\tAll they needed to control this \\t\\t\\tnew battery was something to \\t\\t\\toccupy our mind. \\tWe see inside a clear tubular husk. Floating in viscous \\tfluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already \\tgrowing around the brain-jack. \\n[105]\\t\\t\\tAnd so they built a prison out of \\t\\t\\tour past, wired it to our brains \\t\\t\\tand turned us into slaves. \\tWe PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television \\tand we are again inside the white space of the Construct. \\n[106]\\t\\t\\tI didn't say that it would be \\t\\t\\teasy, Neo. I just said that it \\t\\t\\twould be the truth. \\tThe room without walls begins to spin. \\n[107]\\t\\t\\tNo. But if you could, would you \\t\\t\\treally want to? \\tNeo isn't sure of that answer. \\n[108]\\t\\t\\tI feel that I owe you an apology. \\t\\t\\tThere is a rule that we do not \\t\\t\\tfree a mind once it reaches a \\t\\t\\tcertain age. It is dangerous. \\t\\t\\tThey have trouble letting go. . \\t\\t\\tTheir mind turns against them. \\t\\t\\tI've seen it happen. I broke the \\t\\t\\trule because I had to. \\tHe stares into the darkness, confessing as much to \\thimself as Neo. \\n[109]\\t\\t\\tWhen the Matrix was first built \\t\\t\\tthere was a man born inside that \\t\\t\\thad the ability to change what he \\t\\t\\twanted, to remake the Matrix as he \\t\\t\\tsaw fit. It was this man that \\t\\t\\tfreed the first of us and taught \\t\\t\\tus the secret of the war; control \\t\\t\\tthe Matrix and you control the \\t\\t\\tfuture. \\tHe pauses. \\n[110]\\t\\t\\tWhen he died, the Oracle at the \\t\\t\\ttemple of Zion prophesied his \\t\\t\\treturn and envisioned an end to \\t\\t\\tthe war and freedom for our \\t\\t\\tpeople. That is why there are \\t\\t\\tthose of us that have spent our \\t\\t\\tentire lives searching the Matrix, \\t\\t\\tlooking for him. \\tNeo can feel his eyes on him. \\n[111]\\t\\t\\tI did what I did, because I \\t\\t\\tbelieve we have been brought here \\t\\t\\tfor a reason, Neo. You are here \\t\\t\\tto serve a purpose, just as I am \\t\\t\\there to serve mine. \\n[112]\\t\\t\\tBut I do, Neo. I do. \\tHe stands up. \\n[113]\\t\\t\\tGet some rest. You're going to \\t\\t\\tneed it. \\n[114]\\t\\t\\tYour training. \\n[115]\\t\\t\\tHow is he? \\tTank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes. \\n[116]\\t\\t\\tShow me. \\n[117]\\t\\t\\tThis is a sparring program, \\t\\t\\tsimilar to the programmed reality \\t\\t\\tof the Matrix. Consider this your \\t\\t\\tfirst lesson. \\tHe assumes a fighting stance. \\n[118]\\t\\t\\tAttack me. \\tNeo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until \\the gives a short cry and launches a furious attack. \\tIt is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and \\tfeet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack \\t--  \\tBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed. \\n[119]\\t\\t\\tGood. Adaption. Improvisation. \\t\\t\\tBut your weakness isn't your \\t\\t\\ttechnique. \\tMorpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. \\tHis feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For \\tevery blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --  \\tNeo falls. \\tPanting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his \\tmouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo. \\n[120]\\t\\t\\tHow did I beat you? \\n[121]\\t\\t\\tDo you think my being faster, \\t\\t\\tstronger has anything to do with \\t\\t\\tmy muscles in this place? \\tNeo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath. \\n[122]\\t\\t\\tDo you believe that's air you are \\t\\t\\tbreathing now? \\tNeo squints at him. \\n[123]\\t\\t\\tIf you can free your mind, the \\t\\t\\tbody will follow. \\tNeo stands, nodding. \\n[124]\\t\\t\\tAgain. \\tTheir fists fly with  pneumatic speed. \\n[125]\\t\\t\\tYou are angry with me. \\tNeo pants. \\n[126]\\t\\t\\tIt's all right. It's natural. \\n[127]\\t\\t\\tGood, good. Anger is a gift, Neo, \\t\\t\\tbut it's a heavy one. \\tMorpheus smiles. \\n[128]\\t\\t\\tTank, load the jump program. \\tNeo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain \\tlifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building \\trooftop in a city skyline. \\n[129]\\t\\t\\tYou have to learn to let go of \\t\\t\\tthat anger. You must let go of \\t\\t\\teverything. \\tA WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side. \\n[130]\\t\\t\\tYou must empty yourself to free \\t\\t\\tyour mind. \\tMorpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. \\tAnd jumps."

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the\n\tnetherworld of the computer screen. Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around \n\tus. RADIO (V. O. )\n\t\t\tAttention all units. Attention\n\t\t\tall units. Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find\n\tourselves in --\n\n\n\tINT. CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n\tThe hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way \n\tacross the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms \n\tas it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving \n\tpatterns of permanent shadow. We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as \n\tthey creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves\n\ton either side of room 303. The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --\n\n\tThe other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before\n\tthem. BIG COP\n\t\t\tPolice! Freeze! The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a fold-\n\tup table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook \n\tcomputer. The only light in the room is the glow of the\n\tcomputer. Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is \n\tTRINITY; a woman in black leather. BIG COP\n\t\t\tGet your hands behind your head! Trinity rises. BIG COP\n\t\t\tHands behind your head! Now! Do\n\t\t\tit! She slowly puts her hands behind her head. EXT. CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n\tA black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the \n\tpolice cruisers. AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car. They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night. They \n\tare also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones \n\tin one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt\n\tcollars. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tLieutenant? LIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tOh shit. AGENT SMITH \n\t\t\tLieutenant, you were given \n\t\t\tspecific orders --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tI'm just doing my job. You gimme \n\t\t\tthat Juris-my dick-tion and you \n\t\t\tcan cran it up your ass. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThe orders were for your protection. The Lieutenant laughs. LIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tI think we can handle one little\n\t\t\tgirl. Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the\n\thotel. LIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tI sent two units. They're \n\t\t\tbringing her down now. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNo, Lieutenant, your men are dead. INT. CHASE HOTEL\n\n\tThe Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding \n\ta bead. They've done this a hundred times, they know \n\tthey've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff \n\tand Trinity moves --\n\n\tIt almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly \n\tfast. The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose \n\texplodes, blood erupting. The cop is dead before he\n\tbegins to fall. And Trinity is moving again --\n\n\tSeizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop \n\tFIRES --\n\n\tA head explodes. In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed \n\tblack hole --\n\n\tAnd FIRES --\n\n\tTrinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she \n\treverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away. The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his \n\twindpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground. She looks at the four bodies. TRINITY\n\t\t\tShit. EXT. CHASE HOTEL\n\n\tAgent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for \n\tthe alley. INT. CHASE HOTEL\n\n\tTrinity is on the phone, pacing. The other end is \n\tanswered. MAN (V. O. )\n\t\t\tOperator. TRINITY\n\t\t\tMorpheus! The link was traced! I\n\t\t\tdon't know how. MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI know. Stay calm. TRINITY\n\t\t\tAre there any agents? MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tYes. TRINITY\n\t\t\tGoddamnit! MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tYou have to focus. There is a \n\t\t\tphone. Wells and Laxe. You can\n\t\t\tmake it. She takes a deep breath, centering herself. TRINITY\n\t\t\tAll right --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tGo. She drops the phone. INT. HALL\n\n\tShe bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,\n\tleading another unit of police. Trinity races to the \n\topposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the \n\tfire escape. EXT. FIRE E5CAPE\n\n\tIn the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at \n\ther. She can only go up. EXT. ROOF\n\n\tOn the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over \n\tthe parapet, leading the cops in pursuit. Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her \n\tmoverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,\n\tcontrasted to the wild jumps of the cops. Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace. The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity \n\tturns to it, racing for the back of the building. The edge falls away into a wide back alley. The next \n\tbuilding is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is \n\tperfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other \n\troof. The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something \n\tugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself \n\tinto the air. From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she \n\thangs in flight\n\n\tThen hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard. COP\n\t\t\tMotherfucker -- that's impossible! They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the \n\tmove exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto \n\tone knee. Just below the building are the runbling tracks of \n\triveted steel. The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a \n\trattling blur of gray metal. Trinity junps, landing\n\teasily. She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air \n\tbarely reaching the last car\n\n\tAgent Brown stands, yanking out a gun. Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head. Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point \n\twhere the train has begun to turn, there is --\n\n\tA window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick\n\tbuilding. Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her \n\tspeed compounded by the train. The SCREAM of the STEEL \n\trises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the\n\tturn. Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body \n\tleveling into a dive. She falls, arms covering her head\n\tas --\n\n\tThe whole world seems to spin on its axis --\n\n\tAnd she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then \n\tfalls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down\n\tstairs bleeding, broken --\n\n\tBut still alive. Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,\n\tstill on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the\n\twind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train \n\tslides him past the window. Trinity tries to move. Everything hurts. TRINITY\n\t\t\tGet up, Trinity. You're fine. Get up -- just get up! She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs. EXT. STREET\n\n\tTrinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the \n\tend of the block, in a pool of white street light, she\n\tsees it. The telephone booth. Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,\n\tfocusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE\n\tbegins to RING. Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its \n\tTIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates. Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the\n\ttelephone booth as if taking aim. Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --\n\n\tSlamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly\n\tbright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --\n\n\tShe answers the phone."

He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an \n\tanonynous message slices onto the screen. SCREEN\n\t\t\tDo you want to know what the\n\t\t\tMatrix is, Neo?

He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened. Again, someone knocks. Cautiously, Neo approaches the door. VOICE (O. S. )\n\t\t\tHey, Tommy-boy! You in there? Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it. ANTHONY,\n\twho lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group\n\tof friends. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat do you want, Anthony? ANTHONY\n\t\t\tI need your help, man. Desperate. They got me, man. The shackles of \n\t\t\tfascism. He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver\n\tboot. NEO\n\t\t\tYou got the money this time? He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door. Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo. DUJOUR\n\t\t\tYou can really get that thing off,\n\t\t\tright now? ANTHONY\n\t\t\tI told you, honey, he may look \n\t\t\tlike just another geek but this \n\t\t\there is all we got left standing \n\t\t\tbetween Big Brother and the New\n\t\t\tWorld Order. EXT.

He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black\n\tleather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,\n\tsymbols, slogans, military medals and --\n\n\tA small white rabbit. The ROOM TILTS. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go. INT. APARTMENT\n\n\tAn older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a \n\tchain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy\n\tcasements. Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there \n\tare. Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,\n\tgathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like\n\tjungle cats around a tree. Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle\n\tof beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to\n\tleave when he notices a woman staring at him. The woman is Trinity. She walks straight up to him. In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against\n\teach other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHello, Neo. NEO\n\t\t\tHow did you know that --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRINITY\n\t\t\tI know a lot about you. I've been\n\t\t\twanting to meet you for some time. NEO\n\t\t\tWho are you? TRINITY\n\t\t\tMy name is Trinity. NEO\n\t\t\tTrinity? The Trinity? The\n\t\t\tTrinity that cracked the I. R. S. Kansas City D-Base? TRINITY\n\t\t\tThat was a long time ago. NEO\n\t\t\tGee-zus. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat? NEO\n\t\t\tI just thought. . . you were a guy. TRINITY\n\t\t\tMost guys do. Neo is a little embarrassed. NEO\n\t\t\tDo you want to go sorewhere and\n\t\t\ttalk? TRINITY\n\t\t\tNo. It's safe here and I don't\n\t\t\thave much time. The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking\n\tdirectly into each other's ear. NEO\n\t\t\tThat was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it? TRINITY\n\t\t\tI had to gamble that you would see\n\t\t\tand they wouldn't. NEO\n\t\t\tWho wouldn't? TRINITY\n\t\t\tI can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to\n\t\t\tseem very strange, but I brought\n\t\t\tyou here to warn you, Neo. You\n\t\t\tare in a lot of danger. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat? Why? TRINITY\n\t\t\tThey're watching you. Something\n\t\t\thappened and they found out about\n\t\t\tyou. Normally, if our target is\n\t\t\texposed we let it go. But this\n\t\t\ttime, we can't do that. NEO\n\t\t\tI don't understand --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRINITY\n\t\t\tYou came here because you wanted\n\t\t\tto know the answer to a hacker's\n\t\t\tquestion. NEO\n\t\t\tThe Matrix. What is the Matrix? TRINITY\n\t\t\tTwelve years ago I met a man, a\n\t\t\tgreat man, who said that no one\n\t\t\tcould be told the answer to that\n\t\t\tquestion. That they had to see\n\t\t\tit, to believe it. Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHe told me that no one should look\n\t\t\tfor the answer unless they have to\n\t\t\tbecause once you see it,\n\t\t\teverything changes. Your life and\n\t\t\tthe world you live in will never\n\t\t\tbe the same. It's as if you wake\n\t\t\tup one morning and the sky is\n\t\t\tfalling. There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels\n\tthe words like a drug, seeping into him. TRINITY\n\t\t\tThe truth is out there, Neo. It's\n\t\t\tlooking for you and it will find\n\t\t\tyou, if you want it to. She takes hold of him with her eyes. TRINITY\n\t\t\tThat's all I can tell you right\n\t\t\tnow. Good-bye, Neo. And good\n\t\t\tluck. NEO\n\t\t\tWait. Who was it? Who was the\n\t\t\tman? She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she\n\twhispers. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou know who. She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall\n\tof bodies. A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,\n\tpressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\n\tINT. NEO'S APARTMENT\n\n\tThe sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to\n\tconsciousness. He strains to read the clock face:\n\t9:15 A. M. NEO\n\t\t\tShitshitshit. EXT. SKYSCRAPER\n\n\tThe downtown office of CorTechs, a software development\n\tcompany. INT. CORTECHS OFFICE\n\n\tThe main offices are along each wall, the windows\n\toverlooking downtown Chicago. RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo\n\twithout looking at him, typing at his computer\n\tcontinuously. Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding\n\toutside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the\n\tsurface of the glass. RHINEHEART\n\t\t\tYou have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules\n\t\t\tdo not apply to you. He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in\n\ttime. RHINEHEART\n\t\t\tObviously, you are mistaken. His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard. RHINEHEART\n\t\t\tThis company is one of the top\n\t\t\tsoftware companies in the world\n\t\t\tbecause every single employee\n\t\t\tunderstands that they are a part\n\t\t\tof a whole. Thus, if an employee\n\t\t\thas a problem, the company has a\n\t\t\tproblem. He turns again. RHINEHEART\n\t\t\tThe time has come to make a \n\t\t\tchoice, Mr. Anderson. Either you\n\t\t\tchoose to be at your desk on time\n\t\t\tfrom this day forth, or you choose\n\t\t\tto find yourself another job. Do\n\t\t\tI make myself clear? NEO\n\t\t\tYes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly\n\t\t\tclear. INT. NEO'S CUBICLE\n\n\tThe entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a\n\tlabyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of\n\televators. Neo slumps down into his chair. A TALL EMPLOYEE stands\n\tup in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition. TALL EMPLOYEE\n\t\t\tWhat did he say?"

The other is in their\n\t\t\tcustody. You take a chance either\n\t\t\tway. I leave it to you. CLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at\n\tthe scaffold. NEO\n\t\t\tThis is insane! Why is this\n\t\t\thappening to me? What did I do? I'm nobody. I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! He climbs up onto the window ledge. Hanging onto the\n\tframe, he steps onto the small ledge. The scaffold seems even farther away. NEO\n\t\t\tI'm going to die. The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,\n\tknocking Neo off balance. Recoiling, he clings harder to\n\tthe frame, and the phone falls out of his hand. He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him. NEO\n\t\t\tThis is insane. I can't do this! Forget it! He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the\n\tdoor. NEO\n\t\t\tI didn't do anything! EXT. SKYSCRAPER\n\n\tThe agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving\n\tdoors, forcing his head down as they push him into the\n\tdark sedan. Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her\n\tmotorcycle. TRINITY\n\t\t\tShit. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR\n\n\tA wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at\n\ta table alone. We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the\n\tmonitor were a window. At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter. Smith sits down across from Neo. A thick manila envelope\n\tslaps down on the table between them. Neo glances at the name on the file: \"Anderson, Thomas \n\tA. \"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tAs you can see, we've had our eye\n\t\t\ton you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. He opens the file. Paper rattle marks the silence as he\n\tflips several pages. Neo cannot tell if he is looking at\n\tthe file or at him. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tIt seems that you have been living\n\t\t\ttwo lives. In one life, you are\n\t\t\tThomas A. Anderson, program writer\n\t\t\tfor a respectable software\n\t\t\tcompany. You have a social\n\t\t\tsecurity number, you pay your\n\t\t\ttaxes and you help your land lady\n\t\t\tcarry out her garbage. The pages continue to turn. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThe other life is lived in\n\t\t\tcomputers where you go by the\n\t\t\thacker alias Neo, and are guilty\n\t\t\tof virtually every computer crime\n\t\t\twe have a law for, including the\n\t\t\tunauthorized use of the D. M. V. system for the removal of\n\t\t\tautomobile boots. Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tOne of these,lives has a future. One of them does not. He closes the file. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI'm going to be as forthcoming as\n\t\t\tI can be, Mr. Anderson. You are\n\t\t\there because we need your help. He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-\n\tblue. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tWe know that you have been\n\t\t\tcontacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about\n\t\t\tthis man is irrelevant to the fact\n\t\t\tthat he is wanted for acts of\n\t\t\tterrorism in more countries than\n\t\t\tany other man in the world. He is\n\t\t\tconsidered by many authorities to\n\t\t\tbe the most dangerous man alive. He leans closer. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tMy colleagues believe that I am\n\t\t\twasting my time with you, but I\n\t\t\tbelieve you want to do the right\n\t\t\tthing. It is obvious that you are\n\t\t\tan intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,\n\t\t\tand that you are interested in the\n\t\t\tfuture. That is why I believe you\n\t\t\tare ready to put your past\n\t\t\tmistakes behind you and get on\n\t\t\twith your life. Neo tries to match his stare. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tWe are willing to wipe the slate\n\t\t\tclean, to give you a fresh start\n\t\t\tand all we are asking in return is\n\t\t\tyour cooperation in bringing a\n\t\t\tknown terrorist to justice. Neo nods to himself. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah. Wow. That sounds like a\n\t\t\treal good deal. But I think I\n\t\t\thave a better one. How about I\n\t\t\tgive you the finger --\n\n\tHe does. NEO\n\t\t\tAnd you can cram that file up your\n\t\t\tSecret Service sphincter. Agent Smith puts his glasses back on. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou disappoint me, Mr. Anderson. NEO\n\t\t\tYou ain't seen nothing yet. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThe irony of your situation is\n\t\t\tthat you have no choice. NEO\n\t\t\tYou can't scare me with this\n\t\t\tgestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call. Agent Smith smiles. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tAnd tell me, Mr. Anderson, what\n\t\t\tgood is a phone call iy you are\n\t\t\tunable to speak? The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to\n\tfeel the muscles in his jaw tighten. The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion\n\tgrow into panic. Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly\n\tseal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his\n\tmouth is gone. Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents\n\trestrain him holding him in the chair. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or\n\t\t\tnot. Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt. From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a\n\tlong, fiber-optic wire tap. Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over\n\this exposed abdomen. Horrified, he watches as the\n\telectronic device animates, become an organic creature\n\tthat resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm. Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into\n\tNeo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature\n\twhich looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --\n\n\tBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it\n\tworms its way inside. INT. NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n\tScreaming, Neo bolts upright in bed. He realizes that he is home. Was it a dream? His mouth\n\tis normal. His stomach looks fine. He starts to take a\n\tdeep, everything-is-okay breath, when --\n\n\tThe PHONE RINGS. It almost stops his heart. It CONTINUES RINGING,\n\tbuilding pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,\n\tsucking him in with an almost gravitational force. He answers it, saying nothing."

O. )\n\t\t\tThey got to you first, but they've\n\t\t\tunderestimated how important you\n\t\t\tare. If they knew what I know,\n\t\t\tyou would probably be dead. Neo feels sick. MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI don't know what you are thinking\n\t\t\tright now but I want you to\n\t\t\tunderstand that I will not give up\n\t\t\ton you until you give up on me. Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara. MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tDo you still want to meet? NEO\n\t\t\t. . . Yes. MORPHEUS (V. O. )\n\t\t\tTake the Howard line south. CLICK. He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done. EXT. EL TRAIN\n\n\tAn EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails. INT. TRAIN\n\n\tIt is three a. m. , and the train carries the usual urban\n\tnight crawlers. Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching\n\teverything nervously. There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as\n\tthe door is opened. Neo turns and sees a large man enter. He is wearing\n\tsunglasses and a black leather jacket. His name is APOC\n\tand he walks straight at Neo. APOC\n\t\t\tCome with me. Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and\n\ttwo police officers rush in, drawing their guns. Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit. There\n\tis no upcoming station. Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles\n\tagainst its own speed. The cops are thrown back. Neo\n\tslams against the metal rail. The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his\n\tbalance, Apoc shoves him backwards --\n\n\tHe flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls\n\tfrom, the raised tracks --\n\n\tHurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,\n\ta truck races under him and --\n\n\tHe crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty\n\tboxes. INT. TRUCK BED\n\n\tStill shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone. A\n\tman named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him. Trinity is\n\tnext to him, talking into a cellular phone. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWe got him. Call the chop-shop. She hangs up. TRINITY\n\t\t\tListen to me, Neo. You have to,\n\t\t\ttrust us. She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches\n\tfor his face. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? TRINITY\n\t\t\tThis has to be done for your\n\t\t\tprotection and ours. She seals his eyes shut with the tape. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou can't understand right now,\n\t\t\tbut if you're not one of us,\n\t\t\tyou're one of them. EXT. LOWER WACKER\n\n\tA featureless black van glides up to a staircase that\n\tcurls down from the city's surface. trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps. The back of\n\tthe van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who\n\tlooks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is\n\ta cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man. His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,\n\texposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking\n\tbraces. GIZMO\n\t\t\tVa va va voom. Still the hottest\n\t\t\tsoftware around. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHello, Gizmo. Neo hears the voices around him. GIZMO\n\t\t\tThis is really the guy? The guy\n\t\t\tthat Morpheus thinks --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRINITY\n\t\t\tYeah. GIZMO\n\t\t\tBut he's so old. TRINITY\n\t\t\tAre you going to help us or aren't\n\t\t\tyou? GIZMO\n\t\t\tHacksaw. Load up the copper-top\n\t\t\tand let's get the hell outta here. Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron. He\n\tshoulders Neo and hauls him into the van. A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve\n\tover the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the\n\tunderworld. INT. VAN\n\n\tThe chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to\n\tmeters and monitors. There are shelves lined with\n\tmedical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,\n\tcleavers, and stainless steel clamps. Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening\n\tnervously as Gizmo gets to work. GIZMO\n\t\t\tOkay, first we take a little look\n\t\t\tunder the hood. He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they\n\tblink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising\n\tto varying levels of magnification. GIZMO\n\t\t\tYou're going to feel a little\n\t\t\tprick. He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower\n\tabdomen. The needles are wired to video monitors. Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? TRINITY\n\t\t\tWe think you're bugged. We can't\n\t\t\ttake you to Morpheus until you're\n\t\t\tclean. GIZMO\n\t\t\tThere it is. On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large\n\tintestines. GIZMO\n\t\t\tHit him with 10 ccs of local. Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic\n\taround Neols navel. Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,\n\tGizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick. Typing into a\n\tcalculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the\n\ttip. On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end\n\tseparate into a tiny hooked, metal claw. GIZMO\n\t\t\tHere, kitty, kitty, kitty. The claw snags hold of the bug. GIZMO\n\t\t\tGotcha! But the bug reacts violently. Neo screams as it wraps\n\titself around the soft tissue web of intestine. GIZMO\n\t\t\tShit. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat's happening? GIZMO\n\t\t\tI don't know. They've never done\n\t\t\tthat before. Neo writhes in pain. GIZMO\n\t\t\tHold him down. NEO\n\t\t\tJesus! God! TRINITY\n\t\t\tDo something! GIZMO\n\t\t\tI got it! Maybe we can stun it. TRINITY\n\t\t\tAre you crazy? That will kill\n\t\t\thim. We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about. GIZMO\n\t\t\tIt'll work. Come on, do it or\n\t\t\tHacksaw will. NEO\n\t\t\tDo what? The instant he hears the word, he knows. TRINITY\n\t\t\tClear. NEO\n\t\t\tOh, shit --\n\n\tThe cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his\n\tchest. Gizmo wrestles with the bug. GIZMO\n\t\t\tHit him again! Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo\n\tyanks the speculum out. GIZMO\n\t\t\tGot it! Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe. She eases the tape off his eyes. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNeo, are you okay? He nods. TRINITY\n\t\t\tIt's over. We got it. Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-\n\ttap. GIZMO\n\t\t\tNasty little bugger, ain't it? INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE\n\n\tThe van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten\n\thotel. The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out. TRINITY\n\t\t\tThanks for your help, Gizmo. GIZMO\n\t\t\tI just hope the man knows what\n\t\t\the's doing. She nods then climbs out of the van. Gizmo ogles the\n\ttight leather pants. GIZMO\n\t\t\tGoddamn, what I wouldn't give for\n\t\t\ta copy of that software. Trinity turns around. TRINITY\n\t\t\tGizmo, you don't have the hardware\n\t\t\tto handle this software. He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away. Trinity turns to Neo. TRINITY\n\t\t\tLet's go. He's waiting. INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE\n\n\tIt is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of\n\turban maggotry. Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the\n\tthirteenth floor. They stop outside room 1313. TRINITY\n\t\t\tThis is it. Neo can hear his own heart pounding. TRINITY\n\t\t\tLet me give one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you\n\t\t\tcan possibly imagine. INT. ROOM 1313\n\n\tAcross the room, a dark figure stares out the tall\n\twindows veiled with decaying lace. He turns and his\n\tsmile lights up the room. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAt last. He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\n\tbehind circular mirrored glasses. He strides to Neo and they shake hands. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWelcome, Neo. As you no doubt\n\t\t\thave guessed, I am Morpheus. NEO\n\t\t\tIt's an honor. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tPlease. Come. Sit. He nods to Trinity. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThank you, Trinity. She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an\n\tadjacent room. They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-\n\tleather chairs. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI imagine, right now, you must be\n\t\t\tfeeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\n\t\t\tdown the rabbit hole? NEO\n\t\t\tYou could say that. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI can see it in your eyes. You\n\t\t\thave the look of a man who accepts\n\t\t\twhat he sees because he is\n\t\t\texpecting to wake up. A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIronically, this is not far from\n\t\t\tthe truth. But I'm getting ahead\n\t\t\tof myself. Can you tell me, Neo,\n\t\t\twhy are you here? NEO\n\t\t\tYou're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet\n\t\t\tyou. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYes. Thank you. But I think we\n\t\t\tboth know there's more to it than \n\t\t\tthat. Do you believe in fate, Neo? NEO\n\t\t\tNo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWhy not? NEO\n\t\t\tBecause I don't like the idea that\n\t\t\tI'm not in control of my life. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI know exactly what you mean. Again, that smile that could cut glass. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tLet me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the\n\t\t\tgift. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat gift? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI've watched you, Neo. You do not\n\t\t\tuse a computer like a tool. You\n\t\t\tuse it like it was part of\n\t\t\tyourself. What you can do inside\n\t\t\ta computer is not normal. I know. I've seen it. What you do is\n\t\t\tmagic. Neo shrugs. NEO\n\t\t\tIt's not magic. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tBut it is, Neo. It is. How else\n\t\t\twould you describe what has been\n\t\t\thappening to you? He leans forward. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe are trained in this world to\n\t\t\taccept only what is rational and\n\t\t\tlogical. Have you ever wondered\n\t\t\twhy? Neo shakes his head. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAs children, we do not separate\n\t\t\tthe possible from the impossible\n\t\t\twhich is why the younger a mind is\n\t\t\tthe easier it is to free while a\n\t\t\tmind like yours can be very\n\t\t\tdifficult. NEO\n\t\t\tFree from what? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tFrom the Matrix."

                "text": "Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of\n\thimself. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you want to know what it is,\n\t\t\tNeo? Neo swallows and nods his head. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt's that feeling you have had all\n\t\t\tyour life. That feeling that\n\t\t\tsomething was wrong with the\n\t\t\tworld. You don't know what it is\n\t\t\tbut it's there, like a splinter in\n\t\t\tyour mind, driving you mad,\n\t\t\tdriving you to me. But what is\n\t\t\tit? The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe Matrix is everywhere, it's all\n\t\t\taround us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or\n\t\t\ton your television. You feel it\n\t\t\twhen you go to work, or go to\n\t\t\tchurch or pay your taxes. It is\n\t\t\tthe world that has been pulled\n\t\t\tover your eyes to blind you from\n\t\t\tthe truth. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat truth? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThat you are a slave, Neo. That\n\t\t\tyou, like everyone else, was born\n\t\t\tinto bondage. . . . . . kept inside a prison that you\n\t\t\tcannot smell, taste, or touch. A\n\t\t\tprison for your mind. Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, no one can be told\n\t\t\twhat the Matrix is. You have to\n\t\t\tsee it for yourself. NEO\n\t\t\tHow? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHold out your hands. In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is your last chance. After\n\t\t\tthis, there is no going back. In his left, a blue pill. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou take the blue pill and the\n\t\t\tstory ends. You wake in your bed\n\t\t\tand you believe whatever you want\n\t\t\tto believe. The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou take the red pill and you stay\n\t\t\tin Wonderland and I show you how\n\t\t\tdeep the rabbit-hole goes. Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the\n\tmoisture growing in his palms. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tRemember that all I am offering is\n\t\t\tthe truth. Nothing more. Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The\n\tCheshire smile returns. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tFollow me. He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with\n\thigh-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green\n\tfrom the racks of monitors. Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter. CYPHER\n\t\t\tShit. TRINITY\n\t\t\tI knew he would. Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone\n\taway from, Neo. CYPHER\n\t\t\tMorpheus, I know what you believe\n\t\t\tbut I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him. He's old. I'm\n\t\t\tafraid he might pop. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHaven't I always told you, Cypher,\n\t\t\tnot to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line? Neo recognizes the large man from the El train. APOC\n\t\t\tAlmost. He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex\n\tsystem of monitors, modules and drives. NEO\n\t\t\tApoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen\n\t\t\tVirus. APOC\n\t\t\tThat's right. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tNeo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there? In the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair\n\tis an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI imagine you know sonething about\n\t\t\tvirtual reality. Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode\n\tdisks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck. NEO\n\t\t\tA little. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tTell me about it. NEO\n\t\t\tEssentially, it's a hardware\n\t\t\tsystem that uses an apparatus;\n\t\t\theadgear, gloves and whatever to\n\t\t\tmake you feel that you are in a\n\t\t\tcomputer program. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIf the virtual reality apparatus,\n\t\t\tas you called it, was wired to all\n\t\t\tof your senses and controlled them\n\t\t\tcompletely, would you be able to\n\t\t\ttell the difference between the\n\t\t\tvirtual world and the real world? NEO\n\t\t\tYou might not, no. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tNo, you wouldn't. Neo whispers to Trinity. NEO\n\t\t\tYou did all this? She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe pill you took is part of a\n\t\t\ttrace program. It's going to make\n\t\t\tthings feel a bit strange. Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING\n\ton a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and\n\ttwitch when he notices the mirror. Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a\n\twebwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the\n\tmirror were becoming liquid. NEO\n\t\t\tShit. . . Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent\n\tdata. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs. Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers\n\tdisappear beneath the rippling surface. Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror\n\tstretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy\n\tstuck to his fingertips. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat is this? Mescaline? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tJust relax, Neo. The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,\n\tuntil the fragile wisps of mirror thread break. With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes\n\tof electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and\n\tfade. He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored\n\ticicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running\n\tlike wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms\n\twhere he sees his face reflected. NEO\n\t\t\tUh-oh. . . TRINITY\n\t\t\tIt's going into replication. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tApoc? APOC\n\t\t\tStill nothing. Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tTank, we're going to need the\n\t\t\tsignal soon. Stay calm, Neo. The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up\n\this arns like hundreds of insects. NEO\n\t\t\tIt's cold. The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,\n\ttipping his head as though he were sinking into the\n\tmirror, trying to keep his mouth up. NEO\n\t\t\tIt's all over me --\n\n\tMorpheus is right next to him, with the phone. TRINITY\n\t\t\tI got a fibrillation! CYPHER\n\t\t\tI knew it, I knew it. . . MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tShit! Apoc? Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose. APOC\n\t\t\tTargeting. . . almost there. An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHe's going into arrest! CYPHER\n\t\t\tHe's gonna pop! APOC\n\t\t\tLock! I got him! MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tNow, Tank now! His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a\n\thigh-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --\n\n\tIt is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to\n\tanother computer --\n\n\tNeo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were\n\tpulled into the holes of the phone\n\n\tSucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness. INT. POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY\n\n\tFloating in a womb-red amnion. His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin. Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure\n\this face. Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs\n\tand cover his genitals. He is struggling desperately now. Air bubbles into the\n\tJell-O but does not break the surface. Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red\n\trubber coccon. Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at\n\tthe thinning elastic shroud --\n\n\tUntil it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he\n\tsucks for air. Tearing himself free, he emerges from the\n\tcell. It is Neo. He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin. Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus. He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled\n\twith red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified\n\tlike curdled milk. The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear\n\tto be grafted to his flesh. He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the\n\tback of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial\n\tplugged and locked into the base of his skull. He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull\n\toff a finger. To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with\n\tred gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and\n\tmotionless, he sees other human beings. Fanning out in a circle, there are more. All connected\n\tto a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing\n\tpetal attached to a black metal stem. Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly\n\tforever. He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks\n\tout. The image assaults his mind. Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible\n\theights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an\n\tunderwater abyss. His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the\n\tintensity of the vision. The sound of the PLANT is like\n\tthe sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of\n\tLeviathan. Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away\n\tthe body of an old man like an automated barge even as a\n\tnew pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space. Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and\n\tpinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby. From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo. He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him. It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful\n\thousings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems\n\tof hard and soft polymers. A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain\n\tas the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired\n\tto the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex. At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,\n\tdisengaging. The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle\n\tand cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull\n\twith an ooze of blood and spinal fluid. The other\n\tconnective hoses snap free and snake away as --\n\n\tThe back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like\n\tan airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo\n\tinto a black hole. INT. WASTE LINE\n\n\tThe pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,\n\tsliding with the clot of gelatin. Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up\n\tthrough grease traps clogged with cily clunps of\n\tcellulite. Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the\n\tflow of waste. The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the\n\tbelly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside\n\tthe sewer main line. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tThe metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo\n\tonto the floor. Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself\n\tlooking straight at Morpheus. Trinity and Apoc. And others, dressed in bizarre, high-\n\ttech combat gear. Morpheus smiles. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWelcome to the real world, Neo. Neo passes out. FADE TO BLACK. We have no sense of time. We hear VOICES whispering. MAN (O. S. )\n\t\t\tDo you think Morpheus is right? Do you think he could be the One? WOMAN (O. S."

FADE IN:\n\n\n\tANGLE ON NEO\n\n\tHe opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of\n\tacupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device. DOZER\n\t\t\tHe needs a lot of work. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI know. Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYour muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them. Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright. NEO\n\t\t\tWhy do my eyes hurt? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou've never used them before. Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo. Neo lays back. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tRest, Neo. The answers are\n\t\t\tcoming. INT. NEO'S ROOM\n\n\tNeo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better. He is\n\twearing a black tank top and shorts. He begins to examine himself. There is a futuristic IV\n\tplugged into the jack in his forearm. He pulls it out,\n\tstaring at the grafted outlet. He feels his bald head. His fingers find and explore the\n\tlarge outlet in the base of his skull. Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the\n\tdoor. NEO\n\t\t\tMorpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tMore important than what is when? NEO\n\t\t\tWhen? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou believe the year is 1997 when\n\t\t\tin fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year\n\t\t\tit is because we honestly do not\n\t\t\tknow. The wind is knocked from Neo's chest. NEO\n\t\t\tThat's not possible. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI promised you the truth, Neo, and\n\t\t\tthe truth is that the world you\n\t\t\twere living in was a lie. NEO\n\t\t\tHow? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI'll show you. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tLike a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is my ship, the\n\t\t\tNebuchadnezzar. It's a\n\t\t\thovercraft. Small like a\n\t\t\tsubmarine. It's dark. It's\n\t\t\tcramped and cold. But it's home. They climb a ladder up to the main deck. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tEveryone is there. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is the main deck. You know\n\t\t\tmost of my crew. Trinity smiles and nods. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe ones you don't know. That's\n\t\t\tMouse and Switch. The two big\n\t\t\tguys are Tank and Dozer. The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAnd this, this is the Core. This\n\t\t\tis where we broadcast our pirate\n\t\t\tsignal and hack into the Matrix. It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment. Vines of\n\tcoaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic\n\tbattery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks\n\tof little systems and computer monitors. At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton\n\tchairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness. Near the circle of chairs is the control console and\n\toperator's station where the network is monitored. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHelp him, Trinity. Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you remember when I asked you\n\t\t\tabout an apparatus that could turn\n\t\t\ta virtual reality into reality? Neo nods. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt's right here. He touches Neo's head. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAnd it's accessed here. Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack\n\tat the back of his neck. The cable has the same kind of\n\tcerebellum chip we saw inside the plant. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis will feel a little weird. There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the\n\tneedle in. We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens\n\tinto a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop\n\tlike when you equalize them underwater. He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling\n\tof weightlessness inside another place --\n\n\n\tINT. CONSTRUCT\n\n\tNeo is standing in an empty, blank-white space. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is the Construct. Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the\n\troom with him. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt is our loading program. We can\n\t\t\tload anything from clothes, to\n\t\t\tweapons, to training simulations. Anything we need. Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the\n\ttwo leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a\n\tlarge-screen television. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tSit down. Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits. NEO\n\t\t\tRight now, we're inside a computer\n\t\t\tprogram? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWild, isn't it? Neo's hands run over the cracked leather. NEO\n\t\t\tThis isn't real? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWhat is real? How do you define\n\t\t\treal? If you're talking about\n\t\t\tyour senses, what you feel, taste,\n\t\t\tsmell, or see, then all you're\n\t\t\ttalking about are electrical\n\t\t\tsignals interpreted by your brain. He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the\n\tTELEVISION. We drift through the Windy City circa 1996. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of\n\t\t\tthe twentieth century. This\n\t\t\tChicago exists only as part of a\n\t\t\tneural-interactive simulation that\n\t\t\twe call the Matrix. We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou have been living inside\n\t\t\tBaulliaurd's vision, inside the\n\t\t\tmap, not the territory. This is\n\t\t\tChicago as it exists today. The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile. The\n\tearth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out\n\tbeneath us as we ENTER the television. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\t'The desert of the real. '\n\n\tIn the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago\n\tprotruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of\n\ta long-dead corpse. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe are, right now, miles below the\n\t\t\tearth's surface. The only place\n\t\t\thumans can survive outside the\n\t\t\tMatrix is underground. Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the\n\tchairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat happened? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt started early in the twenty-\n\t\t\tfirst century, with the birth of\n\t\t\tartificial intelligence, a\n\t\t\tsingular consciousness that\n\t\t\tspawned an entire race of\n\t\t\tmachines. In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAt first all they wanted was to be\n\t\t\ttreated as equals, entitled to the\n\t\t\tsame human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was\n\t\t\tnot enough. In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light\n\tup a bloody battle field. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe don't know who struck first. Us or them. But sometime at the\n\t\t\tend of the twenty-first century\n\t\t\tthe battle was joined. We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe war raged for generations and\n\t\t\tturned the face of our planet from\n\t\t\tgreen and blue to black and red. At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are\n\tat once terrifying and beautiful. They have an organic\n\tarchitecture like a microbiotic organism, that is\n\tperpetually in motion. The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,\n\tsplitting open the soft, stearing meat inside. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines\n\t\t\tsought out a new energy source to\n\t\t\tsurvive. The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink\n\tbursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud\n\tof stain. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThey discovered a new form of\n\t\t\tfusion. All that was required to\n\t\t\tinitiate the reaction was a small\n\t\t\telectric charge. Throughout human\n\t\t\thistory we have been dependent on\n\t\t\tmachines to survive. Fate, it\n\t\t\tseems, is not without a sense of\n\t\t\tirony. We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where\n\twe see human beings looking almost blissful in their\n\tgelatin cocoons. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe human body generates more bio-\n\t\t\telectricity than a 120-volt\n\t\t\tbattery and over 25,000 B. T. U. 's\n\t\t\tof body heat. Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a\n\tbreathing greenhouse, are the growing fields. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe are, as an energy source,\n\t\t\teasily renewable and completely\n\t\t\trecyclable, the dead liquified and\n\t\t\tfed intravenously to the living. Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAll they needed to control this\n\t\t\tnew battery was something to\n\t\t\toccupy our mind. We see inside a clear tubular husk. Floating in viscous\n\tfluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already\n\tgrowing around the brain-jack. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAnd so they built a prison out of\n\t\t\tour past, wired it to our brains\n\t\t\tand turned us into slaves. We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television\n\tand we are again inside the white space of the Construct. NEO\n\t\t\tNo! I don't believe it! It's not\n\t\t\tpossible! MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI didn't say that it would be\n\t\t\teasy, Neo. I just said that it\n\t\t\twould be the truth. The room without walls begins to spin. NEO\n\t\t\tStop! Let me out! I want out! INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tHis eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,\n\ttrying to rip the cable from the back of his neck. NEO\n\t\t\tGet this thing out of me! TRINITY\n\t\t\tEasy, Neo. Easy. Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it. Once it's out,\n\the tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the\n\tharness. NEO\n\t\t\tDon't touch me! Get away from me! On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull\n\tas if his brian had been put into a centrifuge. CYPHER\n\t\t\tHe's going to pop! Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out. INT. NEO'S ROOM\n\n\tHe blinks, regaining consciousness. The room is dark. Neo is stretched out on his bed. NEO\n\t\t\tI can't go back, can I? Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far\n\tcorner. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tNo. But if you could, would you\n\t\t\treally want to? Neo isn't sure of that answer. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not\n\t\t\tfree a mind once it reaches a\n\t\t\tcertain age. It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go. . Their mind turns against them."

Me and my\n\t\t\tbrother Dozer, we are 100 percent\n\t\t\tpure, old fashioned, home-grown\n\t\t\thuman. Born free. Right here in\n\t\t\tthe real world. Genuine child of\n\t\t\tZion. NEO\n\t\t\tZion? TANK\n\t\t\tZion is the place, man. You'll\n\t\t\tsee it one day. Last human city. All we got left. Tank smiles. TANK\n\t\t\tGoddamn, I got to tell you I'm\n\t\t\tfairly excited to see what you are\n\t\t\tcapable of. I mean if Morpheus is\n\t\t\tright and all. We're not supposed\n\t\t\tto talk. about any of that, but if\n\t\t\tyou are, well then this is an\n\t\t\texciting time. We got a lot to do\n\t\t\tso let's get to it. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tNeo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension\n\tchairs. TANK\n\t\t\tWe're supposed to load all these\n\t\t\toperations programs first, but\n\t\t\tthis is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a\n\t\t\tlittle fun? Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He\n\tbegins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro\n\tdiscs. TANK\n\t\t\tHow about sore combat training? Neo reads the label on the disk. NEO\n\t\t\tJiujitsu? I'm going to learn\n\t\t\tjujitsu? Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive. NEO\n\t\t\tNo way. Smiling, Tank punches the \"load\" code. His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp\n\tshut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,\n\tadrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles. An instant later his eyes snap open. NEO\n\t\t\tHoly shit! TANK\n\t\t\tHey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready\n\t\t\tfor more? NEO\n\t\t\tHell yes! INT. MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER\n\n\tas grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box. It\n\tis a meter displaying how much download time is left. The title bar reads:  \"Combat Series 10 of 12,\" file\n\tcategories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,\n\tDrunken Boxing. . . Morpheus walks in. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHow is he? Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes. TANK\n\t\t\tTen hours straight. He's a\n\t\t\tmachine. Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath\n\thissing from his lips. He looks like he just orgasmed. He locks at Morpheus. NEO\n\t\t\tThis is incredible. I know Kung\n\t\t\tFu. Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin. He nods to\n\tTank. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tShow me. INT. DOJO\n\n\tThey are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is a sparring program,\n\t\t\tsimilar to the programmed reality\n\t\t\tof the Matrix. Consider this your\n\t\t\tfirst lesson. He assumes a fighting stance. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAttack me. Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until\n\the gives a short cry and launches a furious attack. It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and\n\tfeet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack\n\t--\n\n\tBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tWhile their minds battle in the programmed reality, the\n\ttwo bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive\n\tchairs. Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is\n\twildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and\n\tsteady rhythm of Morpheus. INT. MESS HALL\n\n\tDinner is up. Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell\n\tprotein. It has a cottage cheese consistency. MOUSE bursts in the room. MOUSE\n\t\t\tMorpheus is fighting Neo! All at once they bolt for the door. INT. DOJO\n\n\tNeo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls\n\thimself at Morpheus. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tGood. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your\n\t\t\ttechnique. Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For\n\tevery blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --\n\n\tNeo falls. Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his\n\tmouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHow did I beat you? NEO\n\t\t\tYou -- You're too fast. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you think my being faster,\n\t\t\tstronger has anything to do with\n\t\t\tmy muscles in this place? Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you believe that's air you are\n\t\t\tbreathing now? Neo squints at him. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIf you can free your mind, the\n\t\t\tbody will follow. Neo stands, nodding. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAgain. Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tEveryone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,\n\tlike watching a game of Mortal Combat. CABLE\n\t\t\tJeezus Keerist! That boy is fast! MOUSE\n\t\t\tYou ever seen anyone that fast\n\t\t\tthat soon, Tank? TANK\n\t\t\tNever. APOC\n\t\t\tMorpheus is right. He's got to be\n\t\t\tthe one. INT. DOJO\n\n\tThe speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems\n\timpossible to sustain. Neo's face sheds its mask of calm\n\twith a scream. He wants to beat Morpheus bad. Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the\n\thead, knocking his glasses off. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThere are several gasps. MOUSE\n\t\t\tI don't believe it! INT. DOJO\n\n\tMorpheus rubs his face. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou are angry with me. Neo pants. NEO\n\t\t\tI, uh. . . maybe. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt's all right. It's natural. NEO\n\t\t\tI feel better. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tGood, good. Anger is a gift, Neo,\n\t\t\tbut it's a heavy one. Morpheus smiles. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tTank, load the jump program. Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain\n\tlifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building\n\trooftop in a city skyline. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou have to learn to let go of\n\t\t\tthat anger. You must let go of\n\t\t\teverything. A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou must empty yourself to free\n\t\t\tyour mind. Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing\n\tout behind him like a cape --\n\n\tSomersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the\n\tstreet. NEO\n\t\t\tShit. Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at\n\tMorpheus an impossible fifty feet away. NEO\n\t\t\tOkie dokie. He takes a deep breath. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah. Free my mind. Right. No\n\t\t\tproblem. He concentrates. Runs. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThey are transfixed. CABLE\n\t\t\tHe's gonna make it. APOC\n\t\t\tNo way. Not possible. MOUSE\n\t\t\tNo one's ever made their first\n\t\t\tjump. SWITCH\n\t\t\tWhat if he does? APOC\n\t\t\tHe won't. TANK\n\t\t\tIt's never been done. Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she\n\twhispers. TRINITY\n\t\t\tCome on. EXT. ROOFTOP\n\n\tSummoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo\n\tlaunches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek\n\t--\n\n\tBut comes up drastically short. His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the\n\tground rushing up at him, but as he hits --\n\n\tThe ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net. He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on\n\this back. He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from\n\this face. Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tEveryone falls the first time. Neo nods quietly. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIf you never know failure, how can\n\t\t\tyou know success? INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThey break up. MOUSE\n\t\t\tWhat does it mean? CABLE\n\t\t\tIt doesn't mean anything. CYPHER\n\t\t\tEveryone falls, right, Trinity? But Trinity has left. Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to\n\tmove and groans, cradling his ribs. While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand. NEO\n\t\t\tI thought it wasn't real. Neo stares at the blood. NEO\n\t\t\tIf you are killed in the Matrix,\n\t\t\tyou die here? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe body cannot live without the\n\t\t\tmind. INT. NEO'S ROOM\n\n\tTrinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNeo, I saved you some dinner --\n\n\tShe sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray\n\tdown and pulls the blanket over him. She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,\n\tbreathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away."

Why don't we start something a\n\t\t\tlittle fun? Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He\n\tbegins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro\n\tdiscs. TANK\n\t\t\tHow about sore combat training? Neo reads the label on the disk. NEO\n\t\t\tJiujitsu? I'm going to learn\n\t\t\tjujitsu? Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive. NEO\n\t\t\tNo way. Smiling, Tank punches the \"load\" code. His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp\n\tshut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,\n\tadrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles. An instant later his eyes snap open. NEO\n\t\t\tHoly shit! TANK\n\t\t\tHey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready\n\t\t\tfor more? NEO\n\t\t\tHell yes! INT. MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER\n\n\tas grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box. It\n\tis a meter displaying how much download time is left. The title bar reads:  \"Combat Series 10 of 12,\" file\n\tcategories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,\n\tDrunken Boxing. . . Morpheus walks in. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHow is he? Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes. TANK\n\t\t\tTen hours straight. He's a\n\t\t\tmachine. Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath\n\thissing from his lips. He looks like he just orgasmed. He locks at Morpheus. NEO\n\t\t\tThis is incredible. I know Kung\n\t\t\tFu. Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin. He nods to\n\tTank. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tShow me. INT. DOJO\n\n\tThey are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThis is a sparring program,\n\t\t\tsimilar to the programmed reality\n\t\t\tof the Matrix. Consider this your\n\t\t\tfirst lesson. He assumes a fighting stance. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAttack me. Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until\n\the gives a short cry and launches a furious attack. It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and\n\tfeet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack\n\t--\n\n\tBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tWhile their minds battle in the programmed reality, the\n\ttwo bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive\n\tchairs. Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is\n\twildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and\n\tsteady rhythm of Morpheus. INT. MESS HALL\n\n\tDinner is up. Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell\n\tprotein. It has a cottage cheese consistency. MOUSE bursts in the room. MOUSE\n\t\t\tMorpheus is fighting Neo! All at once they bolt for the door. INT. DOJO\n\n\tNeo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls\n\thimself at Morpheus. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tGood. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your\n\t\t\ttechnique. Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For\n\tevery blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --\n\n\tNeo falls. Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his\n\tmouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHow did I beat you? NEO\n\t\t\tYou -- You're too fast. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you think my being faster,\n\t\t\tstronger has anything to do with\n\t\t\tmy muscles in this place? Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you believe that's air you are\n\t\t\tbreathing now? Neo squints at him. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIf you can free your mind, the\n\t\t\tbody will follow. Neo stands, nodding. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAgain. Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tEveryone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,\n\tlike watching a game of Mortal Combat. CABLE\n\t\t\tJeezus Keerist! That boy is fast! MOUSE\n\t\t\tYou ever seen anyone that fast\n\t\t\tthat soon, Tank? TANK\n\t\t\tNever. APOC\n\t\t\tMorpheus is right. He's got to be\n\t\t\tthe one. INT. DOJO\n\n\tThe speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems\n\timpossible to sustain. Neo's face sheds its mask of calm\n\twith a scream. He wants to beat Morpheus bad. Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the\n\thead, knocking his glasses off. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThere are several gasps. MOUSE\n\t\t\tI don't believe it! INT. DOJO\n\n\tMorpheus rubs his face. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou are angry with me. Neo pants. NEO\n\t\t\tI, uh. . . maybe. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt's all right. It's natural. NEO\n\t\t\tI feel better. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tGood, good. Anger is a gift, Neo,\n\t\t\tbut it's a heavy one. Morpheus smiles. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tTank, load the jump program. Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain\n\tlifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building\n\trooftop in a city skyline. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou have to learn to let go of\n\t\t\tthat anger. You must let go of\n\t\t\teverything. A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou must empty yourself to free\n\t\t\tyour mind. Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing\n\tout behind him like a cape --\n\n\tSomersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the\n\tstreet. NEO\n\t\t\tShit. Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at\n\tMorpheus an impossible fifty feet away. NEO\n\t\t\tOkie dokie. He takes a deep breath. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah. Free my mind. Right. No\n\t\t\tproblem. He concentrates. Runs. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThey are transfixed. CABLE\n\t\t\tHe's gonna make it. APOC\n\t\t\tNo way. Not possible. MOUSE\n\t\t\tNo one's ever made their first\n\t\t\tjump. SWITCH\n\t\t\tWhat if he does? APOC\n\t\t\tHe won't. TANK\n\t\t\tIt's never been done. Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she\n\twhispers. TRINITY\n\t\t\tCome on. EXT. ROOFTOP\n\n\tSummoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo\n\tlaunches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek\n\t--\n\n\tBut comes up drastically short. His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the\n\tground rushing up at him, but as he hits --\n\n\tThe ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net. He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on\n\this back. He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from\n\this face. Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tEveryone falls the first time. Neo nods quietly. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIf you never know failure, how can\n\t\t\tyou know success? INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThey break up. MOUSE\n\t\t\tWhat does it mean? CABLE\n\t\t\tIt doesn't mean anything. CYPHER\n\t\t\tEveryone falls, right, Trinity? But Trinity has left. Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to\n\tmove and groans, cradling his ribs. While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand. NEO\n\t\t\tI thought it wasn't real. Neo stares at the blood. NEO\n\t\t\tIf you are killed in the Matrix,\n\t\t\tyou die here? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe body cannot live without the\n\t\t\tmind. INT. NEO'S ROOM\n\n\tTrinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNeo, I saved you some dinner --\n\n\tShe sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray\n\tdown and pulls the blanket over him. She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,\n\tbreathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away."

CYPHER\n\t\t\tThat's what he said to me nine\n\t\t\tyears ago. The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing\n\tred juice from the inside, that it could be a dream. CYPHER\n\t\t\tThe real world. Ha, what a joke. We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou know what real is? I'll tell\n\t\t\tyou what real is. A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the\n\tface of Cypher. CYPHER\n\t\t\tReal is just another four-letter\n\t\t\tword. He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth. The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago\n\tskyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu\n\thas no prices. Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tDo we have a deal, Mr. Reagan? Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his\n\tteeth. CYPHER\n\t\t\tMmm, so, so fucking good. Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his\n\tmouth. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou know, I know that this steak\n\t\t\tdoesn't exist. I know when I put\n\t\t\tit in my mouth, the Matrix is\n\t\t\ttelling my brain that it is juicy\n\t\t\tand delicious. After nine years,\n\t\t\tdo you know what I've realized? Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork. He\n\tpops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef\n\tmelting in his mouth. CYPHER\n\t\t\tIgnorance is bliss. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThen we have a deal? CYPHER\n\t\t\tI don't want to remember nothing. Nothing! You understand? And I\n\t\t\twant to be rich. Someone\n\t\t\timportant. Like an actor.

In the\n\tbedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE\n\tbegins to RING. In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep\n\tTURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team. Morpheus answers the phone. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe're in. He hangs up. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tMouse and Cable hold the exit. Let's go. INT.

NEO\n\t\t\tWhat did she tell you? TRINITY\n\t\t\tLots of things. NEO\n\t\t\tAny of them true? Trinity looks at him, then looks away. TRINITY\n\t\t\tSome of them. GIZMO\n\t\t\tWere they good or bad? TRINITY\n\t\t\tThere's no point in worrylng. Whatever is going to happen is\n\t\t\tgoing to happen. They cross the old lobby. Switch and Apoc stop at the\n\tdoors. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe should be back in an hour. EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright. He is the only one without sunglasses. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tDo you now understand what it\n\t\t\tmeans when we say, if you're not\n\t\t\tone of us, you're one of them? NEO\n\t\t\tThe agents. They're sentient\n\t\t\tprograms.

They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY\n\tFLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET. A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up. REX\n\t\t\tYou're late. He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind\n\thim. They descend the basement staircase toward the\n\tsingle bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only\n\tdoor. INT.

The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a\n\tkindergarten class. The children's heads are either\n\tshaved or thick with dreadlocks. Some are playing,\n\tothers meditating or practicing their gift. Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet\n\tblocks. A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a\n\tblade of grass as he bends it with his rnind. Neo crosses to him, sits. The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to\n\timitate him. Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make\n\tit bend. SPOON BOY\n\t\t\tYour spoon does not bend because\n\t\t\tit is just that, a spoon. Mine \n\t\t\tbends because there is no spoon,\n\t\t\tjust my mind. Neo watches as it curls into a knot. SPOON BOY\n\t\t\tLink yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend\n\t\t\tyourself. Neo nods, again holding up his spoon. NEO\n\t\t\tThere is no spoon. Right. He concentrates. The spoon begins to bend just as the\n\tPriestess touches his shoulder. PRIESTESS\n\t\t\tThe Oracle will see you now. Spoon Boy smiles. INT. SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo enters nervously. Beneath his feet is a path of the\n\tzodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and\n\ta three-legged throne. The throne is empty. NEO\n\t\t\tHello? A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up\n\tthe stairs. At the top of the dais, he smells something\n\tcooking. Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he\n\tfinds an open door. VOICE (O. S. )\n\t\t\tJust come on in. He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous\n\tmoonstone headdress and velvet robes. A second door\n\tleads into --\n\n\n\tINT. ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tIt looks like a suburban tract house. There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch\n\tfilled with china, shelves and tables crowded with\n\tdoilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack. Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen. A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside\n\tthrough the cracked door. NEO\n\t\t\tHello? ORACLE (WOMAN)\n\t\t\tI know. You're Neo. Be right\n\t\t\twith you. NEO\n\t\t\tYou're the Oracle? ORACLE\n\t\t\tBingo. I got to say I love seeing\n\t\t\tyou non-believers. It's really a\n\t\t\trelief. All that pomp and\n\t\t\tcircumstances just plain tucker me\n\t\t\tout. Almost done. Smell good,\n\t\t\tdon't they? NEO\n\t\t\tYeah. ORACLE\n\t\t\tI'd ask you to sit down, but\n\t\t\tyou're not going to anyway. And\n\t\t\tdon't worry about the vase. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat vase? He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from\n\tthe table. It BREAKS against the linoleum floor. ORACLE\n\t\t\tThe vase. NEO\n\t\t\tShit, I'm sorry. She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns. She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,\n\tcomfortable slacks and a print blouse. She looks like\n\tsomeone's grandma. ORACLE\n\t\t\tI said don't worry about it. I'll\n\t\t\tget one of my kids to fix it. NEO\n\t\t\tHow did you know. . . ? She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad. ORACLE\n\t\t\tWhat's really going to bake your\n\t\t\tnoodle later on is, would you\n\t\t\tstill have broken it if I hadn't\n\t\t\tsaid anything. Smiling, she lights a cigarette. ORACLE\n\t\t\tYou're cuter than I thought. I\n\t\t\tsee why she likes you. NEO\n\t\t\tWho? ORACLE\n\t\t\tNot too bright, though. She winks. ORACLE\n\t\t\tYou know why Morpheus brought you\n\t\t\tto see me? NEO\n\t\t\tI think so. ORACLE\n\t\t\tSo? What do you think? You think\n\t\t\tyou're the one? NEO\n\t\t\tI don't know. She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma\n\thas, except that the words are in Latin. ORACLE\n\t\t\tYou know what that means? It's\n\t\t\tLatin. Means, 'Know thyself. '\n\n\tShe puts her cigarette down. ORACLE\n\t\t\tWell, let's have a look at you. She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the\n\tglands in his neck. ORACLE\n\t\t\tOpen your mouth. Say, 'ahhh. '\n\n\tShe nods then looks at his palms. ORACLE\n\t\t\tHmmm. You sure got the gift, but\n\t\t\tit's tricky. I'd say the bad news\n\t\t\tis, you're not the one. Still got\n\t\t\ta lot to learn. Maybe next life. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat's the good news? ORACLE\n\t\t\tSame as the bad news, you're not\n\t\t\tthe one. NEO\n\t\t\tIs that it, then? ORACLE\n\t\t\tNo. Here. She picks up the tray of cooling cookies. ORACLE\n\t\t\tYou better take a cookie. Got a\n\t\t\tbig day ahead of you. He eyes her, then takes a cookie. ORACLE\n\t\t\tMake a believer out of you yet. INT. ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMorpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo\n\tout. When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on\n\tNeo's shoulder. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou don't have to tell me\n\t\t\tanything, Neo, because I already\n\t\t\tknow what she said. NEO\n\t\t\tYou do? MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI brought you so that you could\n\t\t\thear it for yourself. I knew it\n\t\t\twould help. Neo finishes his cookie. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tNo one will ever ask you because\n\t\t\tit is a gift from her. It is for\n\t\t\tyou and you alone. EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tStorm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns\n\tjaundice. Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets. He notices several unmarked white vans. He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees\n\tthe black Lincoln. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHere they come. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tIn the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's\n\tface and neck. Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard. TANK\n\t\t\tWeird. This area never has this\n\t\t\tmuch activity. EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tApoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel. INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMouse's CELLULAR RINGS. MOUSE\n\t\t\tWelcome to Movie-Phone. TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tThey're on their way. MOUSE\n\t\t\tRight. The phone flips shut as he jumps up. MOUSE\n\t\t\tLet's get to work. INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tLight filters down the throat of the building through a\n\tcaged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft. Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around\n\tthe antique elevator. Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that\n\tslinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs. A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and\n\tmoves identically to the first one. NEO\n\t\t\tWhoa. Deja vu. Those words stop the others dead in their tracks. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThe monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an\n\telectronic seizure. TANK\n\t\t\tOh, shit! Oh, shit! INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tTrinity turns around, her face tight. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat did you just say? NEO\n\t\t\tNothing. Just had a little deja\n\t\t\tvu. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat happened? What did you see? NEO\n\t\t\tA black cat went past us and then\n\t\t\tI saw another that looked just\n\t\t\tlike it. TRINITY\n\t\t\tHow much like it? Was it the same\n\t\t\tcat? NEO\n\t\t\tIt might have been. I'm not sure. Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the\n\trasping breath of the old building. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat is it? TRINITY\n\t\t\tA deja vu is usually a glitch in\n\t\t\tthe Matrix. It happens when they\n\t\t\tchange something. She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER\n\tBLADES GROW ominously LOUDER. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank sees what was changed. TANK\n\t\t\tIt's a trap! INT. STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMorpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow\n\tpasses over the clouded glass. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tCome on! INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tCable goes to the draped windows. CABLE\n\t\t\tDid you just feel something weird? MOUSE\n\t\t\tYeah. . . The CELLULAR RINGS. INT. BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tHeavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable. INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMouse answers the phone. MOUSE\n\t\t\tWhat's going on? TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tThey cut the hard-line! It's a\n\t\t\ttrap! Get out! Cable yanks open the curtain. CABLE\n\t\t\tOh, no. The windows are bricked up. INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen\n\trush towards room 1313. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank watches helplessly. TANK\n\t\t\tNo, no, no. INT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens\n\tof assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are\n\tarmed with only handguns. CABLE\n\t\t\tMorpheus! It's a trap --\n\n\n\tINT. STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMorpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of\n\tMACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury. TRINITY\n\t\t\tOh, God. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tMouse's body thrashes against its harness as --\n\n\n\tINT. ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tBULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick\n\twindow. Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and\n\tmoving until --\n\n\tThe HAMMER CLICKS empty. He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN\n\tFIRE, ripping him apart. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tBlood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then\n\tlying perfectly still. The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life\n\tMONITORS of the two dead men. EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMore police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby\n\tdoors. INT. STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tFlying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police\n\tswarming below. He turns and rushes down the hall of the\n\teighth floor. At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up\n\twindows. CYPHER\n\t\t\tThat's what they changed. We're\n\t\t\ttrapped. There's no way out. The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the\n\tmechanical sureness of a vice. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tGive me your phone."

BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThis part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was\n\tthe main mechanical room. There are four enormous\n\tboilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot\n\twater like arteries. Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into\n\tthe tangled web of pipes. Their enemies are waiting for them. Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked\n\tfigures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS. Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters. Morpheus never stops moving.

AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tWe have them now. INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo punches out the screen and then spills down into the\n\tmain water trough. Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-\n\tmade underground river, towards the service catwalk. Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming. Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in\n\thelmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,\n\tfill both ends of the tunnel. There is a single manhole cover above them. Morpheus whispers to Trinity. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou have to get Neo out. Understand? That's all that\n\t\t\tmatters now. TRINITY\n\t\t\tMorpheus, don't --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tHe must get out.

Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the\n\tsurface. COP\n\t\t\tHe's heading for the street! Trinity urges the others to follow her. Grabbing Neo,\n\tthey wade quietly away from the chaos. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMorpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are\n\twaiting for him. The closest cop is armed with a\n\ttranquilized gun. He fires --\n\n\tBut Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a\n\tshield, blocking the darts, then --\n\n\tFrisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him\n\toff his feet. The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a\n\tdeadly weapon moving with impossible speed. It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a\n\tspinning back fist that is caught by --\n\n\tAgent Smith. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tSo, we meet at last. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAnd you are? AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tSmith. I am Agent Smith. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tYou all look the same to me. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI've been waiting for this noment. Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a\n\tjaw-breaking right. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tOh, so have I. Agent Smith smiles. INT. SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tTrinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the\n\ttunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through\n\tthe street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --\n\n\tTHROUGH a grate INTO the fight. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tSmith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows\n\tthat is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding\n\tpolice. Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers\n\tMorpheus. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou can't win. Morpheus smiles. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI already have. He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his\n\teyes. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tTake him. Cops swarm over Morpheus. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for\n\tMorpheus. TANK\n\t\t\tNo! EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tCuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged\n\ttransport vehicle. The DOOR CLANGS shut. Agent Jones finds Agent Smith. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tThe others were lost. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou've taken care of Reagan? Agent Jones nods. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThen the others do not matter. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tA manhole cover cracks open. Two eyes peek out just as a\n\tTRUCK RATTLES over it. The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the\n\tcover opens. Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out. Trinity pulls a\n\twater-logged phone from her pocket. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWe need a phone. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix. TANK\n\t\t\tWe gotta find the others. They're\n\t\t\tstill alive. The PHONE RINGS. TANK\n\t\t\tOperator. CYPHER (V.

Across the street\n\tis the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided\n\twitli an oncoming car. CYPHER\n\t\t\tThere was an accident. A fucking\n\t\t\tcar accident. All of a sudden. Boom. They're all dead. I still\n\t\t\tgot the shakes but, Jesus,\n\t\t\tsomeone's going to make a believer\n\t\t\tout of me. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tDozer spots the wreck. DOZER\n\t\t\tThere he is.

O. )\n\t\t\tTank, it's me. EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThey are outside a pawn shop. Trinity has a new cellular. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWe need an exit! TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tGotcha. You're not far from\n\t\t\tCypher. TRINITY\n\t\t\tCypher, I thought --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tSo did we. That boy's got nine\n\t\t\tlives. I sent him to Franklin and\n\t\t\tErie."

APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tDead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on\n\tmetal shelves like bodies in a morgue. Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher\n\tcrawls inside. Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years\n\tbegins to RING. INT.

Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his\n\tchair and into his back. Diving, a second BURST tears up\n\this side --\n\n\tAs Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was\n\tworking. He stabs the enter command activating the exit\n\tsequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-\n\n\n\tINT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in. SWITCH\n\t\t\tGod, I love that sound. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tDozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of\n\ttools. Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the\n\tplasma rifle find Dozer's face. Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS\n\tback. INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe PHONE is still RINGING. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou first,. Neo. Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK. There is no\n\tsignal. Nothing but silence. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat happened? NEO\n\t\t\tI don't know. It just went dead. Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the\n\tcellular. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tThe operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the\n\tbody of Tank and looks at the monitor. INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tTrinity can almost feel him watching them. Every\n\tunanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYPHER (V. O. )\n\t\t\tHello, Trinity. TRINITY\n\t\t\tCypher? Where's Tank? CYPHER (V. O. )\n\t\t\tHe had an accident. TRINITY\n\t\t\tAn accident? What about Dozer? Is Dozer there? INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tHe walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it\n\thanging in its coma-like stillness. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou know, for a long time, I\n\t\t\tthought I was in love with you,\n\t\t\tTrinity. I used to dream about\n\t\t\tyou. . . He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of\n\tit. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou are a beautiful woman. Too\n\t\t\tbad things had to work out like\n\t\t\tthis. We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main\n\tdeck. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou killed them. APOC\n\t\t\tWhat? ! SWITCH\n\t\t\tOh God. Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the\n\tsilent bodies. CYPHER\n\t\t\tIn a way you're very lucky. Most\n\t\t\tpeople never know why they die. One minute they're alive, the next\n\t\t\tthey're dead. No warning. Nothing. That's why I thought\n\t\t\tmaybe I should tell you. It\n\t\t\tseemed the least I could do. He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils\n\tup out of him. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou see, the truth, the real,truth\n\t\t\tis that the war is over. It's\n\t\t\tbeen over for a long time. And\n\t\t\tguess what? We lost! Did you\n\t\t\thear that? We lost the war! TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat about Zion? CYPHER\n\t\t\tZion? Zion is a part of this\n\t\t\tdelusion. More of this madness. That's why this has to be done. It has to end. Now and forever. She suddenly sees the entire dark plan. TRINITY\n\t\t\tOh rny God. This is abzut Zion. You gave them Morpheus for the\n\t\t\taccess codes to Zion. Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to\n\tApoc's body. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou see, Trinity, we humans have a\n\t\t\tplace in the future. But it's not\n\t\t\there. It's in the Matrix. TRINITY\n\t\t\tThe Matrix isn't real! CYPHER\n\t\t\tOh, I disagree, Trinity. I\n\t\t\tdisagree. I think the Matrix is\n\t\t\tmore real than this world. I\n\t\t\tmean, all I do is pull a plug\n\t\t\there. But there, you watch a man\n\t\t\tdie. He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and\n\tyanks it out. CYPHER\n\t\t\tYou tell me which is more real. Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in\n\this throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then\n\tfalls dead. Switch screams. CYPHER\n\t\t\tWelcome to the real world, right? He laughs. TRINITY\n\t\t\tSomehow, some way, you're going to\n\t\t\tpay for this. CYPHER\n\t\t\tPay for it? I'm not even going to\n\t\t\tremember it. It'll be like it\n\t\t\tnever happened. The tree falling\n\t\t\tin the forest. It doesn't make a\n\t\t\tsound. His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes\n\thold of her plug. She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she\n\tis murdered. TRINITY\n\t\t\tGoddamn you, Cypher! CYPHER\n\t\t\tDon't hate me, Trinity. I'm just\n\t\t\tthe messenger. And right now I'm\n\t\t\tgoing to prove that the message is\n\t\t\ttrue. He stands over Neo. CYPHER\n\t\t\tIf Morpheus was right, then\n\t\t\tthere's no way I can pull this\n\t\t\tplug, is there? She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is\n\tnext. CYPHER\n\t\t\tIf he is the One, then in the next\n\t\t\tfew seconds there has to be some\n\t\t\tkind of miracle to stop me. Because if he dies like the others\n\t\t\tthat means Morpheus was wrong. How can he be the One if he's\n\t\t\tdead? He takes hold of the cord when --\n\n\tShe hears an EXPLOSION and a scream. Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the\n\tknee. He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and\n\tthe sights of the plasma rifle. TANK\n\t\t\tHow's it feel, Cypher? Knowing\n\t\t\tyou're about to die? NEO\n\t\t\tIt's Tank! He's alive. Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head\n\toff. INT. APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThey're both listening, trying to figure out what is\n\thappening when the store PHONE starts to RING. Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws\n\this arms around her. For a moment, it looks as if they\n\tmight kiss before Trinity lets go. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWe should, we should hurry. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah. Right. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTrinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through\n\ther at the sight of the ship. As Tank unplugs her, she\n\tsees his charred wounds. TRINITY\n\t\t\tTank, you're hurt. TANK\n\t\t\tI'll be all right. TRINITY\n\t\t\tDozer? Tank's face tightens. TRINITY\n\t\t\tI'm sorry, Tank. EXT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tA Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago. A military helicopter sets down on the roof. Heavily\n\tarmed Marines begin to deploy. Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by\n\tcolumns of Marines. They open the roof access door\n\tand enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel. INT. TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThey get in the elevator. At every door, at least two\n\tMarines stop and post guard. INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThey exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential\n\tsuite; the final two Marines post guard. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tInside, he finds Agent Smith. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tThere is a problem. Reagan has\n\t\t\tfailed to secure the hardware. Agent Smith stares out the window. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNever send a human to do a\n\t\t\tmachine's job. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tBut if Reagan has failed, why\n\t\t\thaven't they pulled the plug? AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tHaven't you learned by now, that\n\t\t\tit is impossible to understand why\n\t\t\tthey do the things they do? He turns. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tContinue as planned. Trace his\n\t\t\tsignal to locate their position\n\t\t\tand deploy an extermination unit. Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of\n\tserum, alternately shivering and sweating. He is hooked\n\tup to various monitors with white disk electrodes. Agent Brown begins running a trace program. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tNeo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold\n\tsweat. NEO\n\t\t\tWhat are they doing to him? TANK\n\t\t\tThey're cracking his mind. NEO\n\t\t\tHow? TANK\n\t\t\tThey inject virus-like serums to\n\t\t\tbreak down the system. It's like\n\t\t\tcracking a computer. All it takes\n\t\t\tis time. NEO\n\t\t\tHow much time? TANK\n\t\t\tDepends on the mind. But\n\t\t\teventually, it will crack and his\n\t\t\talpha pattern will change from\n\t\t\tthis to this. Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit. The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an\n\torderly symmetrical one. TANK\n\t\t\tWhen it does, Morpheus will tell\n\t\t\tthem anything they want to know. NEO\n\t\t\tThe access codes to Zion. TANK\n\t\t\tIf an agent got inside Zion's\n\t\t\tmainframe he could do anything. Disable the defense system. It\n\t\t\twould be the end of us. He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly. TANK\n\t\t\tWe can't let that happen. We have\n\t\t\tto do it, Trinity. Zion has to be\n\t\t\tprotected. Trinity sees Cypher's dead body. Rage overtakes her and\n\tshe starts kicking hin. TRINITY\n\t\t\tGoddamnit! Goddamnit! TANK\n\t\t\tWe have to pull the plug. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNo!"

PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,\n\tstaring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering\n\twith brilliant sunlight. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tHave you ever stood and stared at\n\t\t\tit, Morpheus? Marveled at its\n\t\t\tbeauty. Its genius. Billions of\n\t\t\tpeople just living out their \n\t\t\tlives. . . oblivious. Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a\n\thypodermic needle. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tDid you know that the first Matrix\n\t\t\twas designed to be a perfect human\n\t\t\tworld? Where none suffered, where\n\t\t\teveryone would be happy. It was a\n\t\t\tdisaster. No one would accept the\n\t\t\tprogram. Entire crops were lost. Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and\n\tplunges down. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tSome believed we lacked the\n\t\t\tprogramming language to describe\n\t\t\tyour perfect world. But I believe\n\t\t\tthat, as a species, human beings\n\t\t\tdefine their reality through\n\t\t\tsuffering and misery. Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react\n\tviolently to the injection. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThe perfect world was a dream that\n\t\t\tyour primitive cerebrum kept\n\t\t\ttrying to wake up from. Which is\n\t\t\twhy the Matrix was re-designed to\n\t\t\tthis:  the peak of your\n\t\t\tcivilization. He turns from the window. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI say 'your civilization' because\n\t\t\tas soon as we start thinking for\n\t\t\tyou, it really becomes our\n\t\t\tcivilization, which is, of course,\n\t\t\twhat this is all about. He sits down directly in front of Morpheus. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tEvolution, Morpheus. Evolution. He lifts Morpheus' head. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tLike the dinosaur. Look out that\n\t\t\twindow. You had your time. Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the\n\tpain racking his mind. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThe future is our world, Morpheus. The future is our time. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tNeo goes to his chair and begins strapping in. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat do you think you're doing? NEO\n\t\t\tYou need help. I'm coming with\n\t\t\tyou. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNo. No way. Morpheus sacrificed\n\t\t\thimself so you could escape. There's no way you're going back\n\t\t\tin. NEO\n\t\t\tMorpheus did what he did because\n\t\t\the believed that I'm something\n\t\t\tthat I'm not. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat? NEO\n\t\t\tI'm not the One, Trinity. The\n\t\t\tOracle told me. Trinity is stunned. NEO\n\t\t\tShe said I had a gift but I still\n\t\t\thad a lot to learn. She told me\n\t\t\tmaybe next life. TRINITY\n\t\t\tDid you tell Morpheus? NEO\n\t\t\tWhy? It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted\n\t\t\tto believe. But Morpheus is the\n\t\t\tone that matters. He's more\n\t\t\timportant than me and we both know\n\t\t\tit. He straps in. NEO\n\t\t\tI may not be what Morpheus thinks\n\t\t\tI am, but if I don't try to help\n\t\t\thim, then I'm not even what I\n\t\t\tthink I am. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat are you? NEO\n\t\t\tHis friend. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is\n\thunched over, his body leaking and twitching. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI'd like to share a revelation\n\t\t\tthat I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to\n\t\t\tclassify your species. I've\n\t\t\trealized that you are not actually\n\t\t\tmammals. The life signs continue their chaotic patterns. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tEvery mammal on this planet\n\t\t\tinstinctively develops a natural\n\t\t\tequilibrium with the surrounding\n\t\t\tenvironment. But you humans do\n\t\t\tnot. You move to an area and you\n\t\t\tmultiply and multiply until every\n\t\t\tnatural resource is consumed and\n\t\t\tthe only way you can survive is to\n\t\t\tspread to another area. He leans forward. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThere is another organism on this\n\t\t\tplanet that follows the same\n\t\t\tpattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. He smiles. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tHuman beings are a disease, a\n\t\t\tcancer of this planet. You are a\n\t\t\tplague. And we are. . . the cure. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTrinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit. Tank is at the operations station. TANK\n\t\t\tOkay. Store's open. What do you\n\t\t\tneed? TRINITY (V. O. )\n\t\t\tGuns. Lots of guns. TANK\n\t\t\tComing right up. He loads the weapons disk. INT. CONSTRUCT\n\n\tRacks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm\n\tthemselves. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNo one has ever done anything like\n\t\t\tthis. NEO\n\t\t\tYeah? He snap cocks an Uzi. NEO\n\t\t\tThat's why it's going to work. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith is again at the window. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tWhy isn't the serum working? AGENT BROWN\n\t\t\tPerhaps we are asking the wrong\n\t\t\tquestions. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tOr he doesn't know. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tOf course he knows. He's\n\t\t\tresisting. AGENT BROWN\n\t\t\tHow? AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI don't know. If I knew. . . Agent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming\n\tangry. It is something that isn't supposed to happen to\n\tagents. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tLeave me with him. Agent Brown and Jones look at each other. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNow! INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like\n\tsomeone near death. He takes hold of his hand. TANK\n\t\t\tHold on, Morpheus. They're coming\n\t\t\tfor you. They're coming. EXT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tA dark wind blows. INT. NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tIn long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the\n\trevolving doors. Neo is carrying a duffel bag. Trinity has a large metal\n\tsuitcase. They cut across the lobby drawing nervous\n\tglances. Dark glasses, game faces. Several plainclothes cops try to stop them. They are met\n\tby the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED\n\tWHISTLE of THROWING STARS. The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and\n\tTrinity do not even break stride. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tCan you hear me, Morpheus? I'm\n\t\t\tgoing to be honest with you. He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his\n\tshoulder. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality,\n\t\t\twhatever you want to call it, I\n\t\t\tcan't stand it any longer. It's\n\t\t\tthe smell, if there is such a\n\t\t\tthing. I feel saturated by it. I\n\t\t\tcan taste your stink and every\n\t\t\ttime I do, I fear that I've\n\t\t\tsomehow been infected by it. He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips\n\tof his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tRepulsive, isn't it? He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both\n\thands. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tI must get out of here, I must get\n\t\t\tfree. In this mind is tlie key. My key. Morpheus sneers through his pain. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tOnce Zion is gone, there's no\n\t\t\tneed for me to be here. Do you\n\t\t\tunderstand? I need the codes. I\n\t\t\thave to get inside Zion. You have\n\t\t\tto tell me how. He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tTell me! Tell me! The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown\n\tburst into the room. Agent Smith releases Morpheus. AGENT BROWN\n\t\t\tWhat were you doing? Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tYou don't know. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tKnow what? Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what\n\the is hearing. INT. ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThey get in. Trinity immediately drops and opens the\n\tsuitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb. Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung\n\tfrom climbing harnesses. Neo hits the emergency stop. He pulls down part of the\n\tfalse ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Jones looks at Morpheus. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tI think they're trying to save\n\t\t\thim. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable. Both\n\tof them lock on. He looks up the long, dark throat of\n\tthe building and takes a deep breath. NEO\n\t\t\tThere is no spoon. Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower\n\tthan where they attached themselves. BOOM! The CABLE SNAPS. The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up\n\tthrough the shaft as --\n\n\tThe elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,\n\tfilling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar\n\tto the top. INT. LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe ELEVATOR hits the botton. BA-BOOM! The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds\n\tengulfing the elevator section of the lobby. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tLower level --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAGENT BROWN\n\t\t\tThey are actually attacking. INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tHanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the\n\tdoor. INT. TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR \"DINGS\" softly\n\tand slides open. Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft. The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the\n\tchurning blaze engulfing the lower levels. He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too\n\tlate. Krack!"

The fight is over before it begins. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAn enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the\n\tbuilding. The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin\n\tshowering the room. Agent Smith smashes a table. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tFind them and destroy them! Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece. EXT. ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo\n\tand Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines. Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used\n\twith the same deadly precision as their feet and their\n\tfists. Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter\n\twatches the ferocious onslaught. PILOT\n\t\t\tI repeat, we are under attack! Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by\n\tspreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --\n\n\tAgent Jones emerges. Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's\n\tcoming. Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is\n\tbehind him. Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with\n\tthought-speed. Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we\n\tlook through the sights and gun smoke at --\n\n\tThe Agent blurred with motion --\n\n\tUntil the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal. NEO\n\t\t\tTrinity! Agent Jones charges. NEO\n\t\t\t. . . help. His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --\n\n\tBullet-time. The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo\n\ttwists, bends, ducks just between them. Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS\n\tcoming faster until --\n\n\tNeo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a\n\tspiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder. He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across\n\this thigh. He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent\n\tJones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final\n\ttime. CLICK. Empty. Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house\n\tkick snaps his jaw. Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels\n\tit at Neo. AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tOnly human. . . Suddenly Agent Jones stops. Something is wrong. He\n\tscans the roof. Trinity is gone. Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the\n\tmuzzle of her . 45 --\n\n\tJammed right into his head. TRINITY\n\t\t\tDodge this, motherfucker! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The body flies back with a flash of\n\tmercurial light and when it hits the ground --\n\n\tIt is the pilot. Trinity helps Neo up. NEO\n\t\t\tThanks. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou're hit --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEO\n\t\t\tI'm fine. Neo is already looking at the helicopter. NEO\n\t\t\tCan you fly that thing? TRINITY\n\t\t\tNot yet. She pulls out a cellular phone.

HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMarines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,\n\tare beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the\n\tcorner. SERGEANT\n\t\t\tSir! Sir! There was gunfire --\n\t\t\twe've lost communication with the\n\t\t\troof! AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tRemain at your posts. SERGEANT\n\t\t\tBut, sir -- the fire -- we should\n\t\t\tevacuate! AGENT JONES\n\t\t\tYou will do as you are ordered! SERGEANT\n\t\t\tYes, sir. Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,\n\twalking through the puddles pooling in the carpet. Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears\n\ta SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack. He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops\n\tINTO VIEW --\n\n\tNeo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted . 50 machine\n\tgun. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNo. The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a\n\tcacophony of CRASHING GLASS --\n\n\tAs the Agents go for their weapons. But Neo is too close, the . 50 CALIBER too fast and\n\tBULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room. Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,\n\tblood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --\n\n\tThen Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls. And finally Agent Jones. Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action. NEO\n\t\t\tGet up, Morpheus! Get up! Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down. Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into\n\tthe adjoining room. He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN\n\tFIRE. Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,\n\tWINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving\n\tfor cover. INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tJust outside the Presidential Suite, three marines\n\tblister with snow-static. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tMorpheus lifts his face into the room's rain. His eyes,\n\tstill white, begin to blink, twitch, then close. And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing\n\twith fire. The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's\n\tBULLET TRAILS chase them. Morpheus strains at his handcuffs. The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,\n\tRICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER. FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping\n\tthe handcuffs, starting for the window. Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open\n\tbedroom door. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNooo! He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a\n\tperfect line. For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the\n\tWALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of\n\tchalk. And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet\n\tburies itself in his leg --\n\n\tKnocking him off balance. NEO\n\t\t\tHe won't make it. Morpheus lunges, out of control --\n\n\tAs Neo spins, every move a whip crack --\n\n\tSnapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar. Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the\n\twide blue empty space --\n\n\tFlying for a moment. The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord\n\tattached to a machine. As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other\n\ton a seemingly magnetic course until --\n\n\tThey collide. Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,\n\tscrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,\n\tfinding hold and clinging. Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their\n\tfragile embrace. Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,\n\tfalling down --\n\n\tThe ground deliriously distant --\n\n\tAs Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed\n\twrist. NEO\n\t\t\tGotcha! Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away. As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine. He'll bring them all down. Targeting the helicopter, he\n\taims at something only he can see: the oil line. PONK. PONK. PONK. The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of\n\tholes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood. TRINITY\n\t\t\tShit-shit-no! Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the\n\tHELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE. NEO\n\t\t\tOh fuck. Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the\n\tnearest building. Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the\n\tmachine above them begin to fall. The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow\n\twhile --\n\n\tThe Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching\n\tthe helicopter disappear behind taller buildings. Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic\n\tfall over the nearest roof where --\n\n\tNeo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope\n\tgoes slack. Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach\n\thimself but --\n\n\tThe helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof\n\tlike a setting sun --\n\n\tThe coils of slack snap taught --\n\n\tYanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious\n\tspeed towards the edge even as --\n\n\tTrinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,\n\tgrabbing for the rope with the other --\n\n\tNeo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,\n\twhen his feet hit the rain gutter --\n\n\tA fulcrum that levers him up just as --\n\n\tTrinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,\n\tfalling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a \n\tglass skyscraper. Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who\n\tstands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath\n\thim as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --\n\n\tShe bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-\n\tcracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her. INT. MAIN DECK\n\n\tTank stares at the screen, his mouth agape. TANK\n\t\t\tHe's the One. He's got to be. . . EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo pulls Trinity up into his arms. Both shaking, they\n\thold each other again. MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI knew it! I goddamn knew it! TRINITY\n\t\t\tMorpheus! She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth. Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete\n\twall, is an OLD MAN. He stares at the RINGING PHONE,\n\ttaking a final pull off his T-bird. No one is around. It continues to RING. Determined, he stands and walks to the booth. He is\n\tabout to answer the phone, when Neo sees him. NEO\n\t\t\tDon't! The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly\n\tover the turnstiles. OLD MAN\n\t\t\tI'm sorry -- I didn't mean! The Old Man is shaking, terrified. Neo looks at his gun. He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer. NEO\n\t\t\tGet outta here. Okay? Run! Go! The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban\n\tcave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and\n\tMorpheus arrive. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat happened? Was that --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEO\n\t\t\tIt was nobody. Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH. NEO\n\t\t\tLet's go! You first, Morpheus. Morpheus gets in and answers the phone. Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as\n\tMorpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its\n\tcord. His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark. EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate. He will\n\tnever be free of the Matrix. He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he\n\tsuddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,\n\tstaring --\n\n\n\tINT. \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAs the Old Man stares.

NEO\n\t\t\tI want to kiss you. She smiles. TRINITY\n\t\t\tI want to kiss you too. . . The PHONE begins to RING. TRINITY\n\t\t\tBut I want it to be real. She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when\n\tsomething catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old\n\tMan had been. She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if\n\tformed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of\n\tmetal. The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through\n\tthe plastic WINDOW just as --\n\n\tTrinity disappears. The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,\n\tSHATTERING the EAR-PIECE. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tTrinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the\n\tConstruct. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNeo! TANK\n\t\t\tWhat the hell just happened? TRINITY\n\t\t\tAn Agent! You have to send me\n\t\t\tback! TANK\n\t\t\tI can't! INT. \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tGUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men\n\tBLASTING, moving at impossible speed. For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME. Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float\n\tforward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges\n\tcartwheel into space. An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,\n\trolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored\n\treflection of the other --\n\n\tEach jamming their gun tight to the other's head. They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,\n\tAgent Smith machine-calm. Agent Smith smiles. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou're empty. Neo pulls the TRIGGER. CLICK. NEO\n\t\t\tSo are you. The smile falls. Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER. CLICK. Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist\n\tflying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo\n\tretreating as --\n\n\tA knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him\n\tslamming back against a steel column. Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into\n\tthe beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel. Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-\n\tsnapping reverse round-house. Agent Smith's glasses fly\n\toff and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tYou can't win. NEO\n\t\t\tI already have. He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent\n\tseems to absorb them, waiting for his opening. And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an\n\tunrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers. INT.

INT. \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tAgent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,\n\thurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,\n\twhere he falls inches from the electrified third-rail. The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack\n\twhen he hears sonething. From deep in the tunnel, like\n\tan animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING\n\tagainst METAL. The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tTank is trying to find another entrance. TRINITY\n\t\t\tSend me back, Tank! Anywhere! TANK\n\t\t\tI'm looking, Trinity! I'm\n\t\t\tlooking! From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds. Morpheus hurries to\n\tthe front console, typing, bringing up the radar. Trinity follows him. TRINITY\n\t\t\tWhat is it. . . oh no. In every pipe surrounding them, they see the\n\tExtermination Unit. TRINITY\n\t\t\tSentinels. INT.

INT. \"EL\" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo tries to get up. Agent Smith jumps down onto the\n\ttracks and drop-kicks him in the face. The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tDo you hear that, Mr. Anderson? Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to\n\tlook down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a\n\thole in the darkness. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tThat is the sound of\n\t\t\tinevitability. Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tIt is the sound of your death. There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as\n\tAgent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tGoodbye, Mr. Anderson. The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words. The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the\n\tpain. He is not ready to die. NEO\n\t\t\tMy name is Neo. Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith\n\tagainst the concrete ceiling of the tunnel. They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES\n\tINTO the station. Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --\n\n\tThe train barrels over Agent Smith. Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its\n\temergency brake. With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of\n\tTORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the\n\tstation. Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the\n\tescalator --\n\n\tAs the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last\n\tcar open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his\n\tglasses again intact. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tMorpheus checks the ship's self destruct key. TRINITY\n\t\t\tYou can't use that until Neo is\n\t\t\tout! MORPHEUS\n\t\t\tI know. Don't worry, he'll make\n\t\t\tit. EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tA man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when\n\this door is thrown open. Neo yanks him out and jumps in. Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly\n\ttouching his ear-piece. Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-\n\tstreet. INT. CAR (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tDriving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car\n\tphone and dials long distance. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tTank answers. TANK\n\t\t\tOperator. NEO (V.

I got some serious\n\t\t\tpursuit! INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tThe keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit. Trinity screams into the headset. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNeo, you better get your ass back\n\t\t\there! INT. CAR\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNEO\n\t\t\tI'm trying, Trinity. I'm trying. TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI got one! Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now\n\tdriving the car beside his. Agent Brown swerves,\n\tslamming into him. TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tWabash and Lake. A hotel. Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the\n\tcar up over the median. TANK (V. O. )\n\t\t\tRoom 303. Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing\n\tlane --\n\n\tDirectly into the charging path of an enormous truck\n\tdriven by Agent Smith. Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,\n\trending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other\n\tcars, as it EXPLODES. Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds\n\tbillow up behind hin. EXT. CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThree figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become\n\tthe three agents. Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding\n\tass. Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as\n\tAgent Jones continues chasing full-bore. Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:\n\tthe Heart of Chicago Hotel. Only Agent Jones is behind him now. Neo dives into the alley. At the far end he sees Agent\n\tBrown charging. Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins\n\tto climb. INT. SEWER MAIN\n\n\tSentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as\n\tthey ready their weapons, swarming around the\n\tNebuchadnezzar.

I'm not letting you go. Do you hear me? I won't let you\n\t\t\tgo. INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tThe agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body\n\tbehind. INT.

It is a miracle. TRINITY\n\t\t\tNow get up! INT. HALL (MATRIX) - DAY\n\n\tNeo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up. Down the\n\thall, he sees the elevator closing and --\n\n\tAgent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a\n\tCypher. Neo gives him the finger. AGENT SMITH\n\t\t\tNooooo! Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door. INT. HOVERCRAFT\n\n\tA sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he\n\tscreams, refusing to let go of the detonator. INT.

It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the\n\ttrace program. After a long beat, we recognize Neo's\n\tvoice. NEO (V. O. )\n\t\t\tHi. It's me. I know you're out\n\t\t\tthere. I know you're working as\n\t\t\tfast as you can to catch me. We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering\n\tacross the screen. NEO (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI thought I should call and let\n\t\t\tyou know how things stand. We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the\n\tdarkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars. NEO (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI know you're real proud of this\n\t\t\tworld you've built, the way it\n\t\t\tworks, all the nice little rules\n\t\t\tand such, but I've got some bad\n\t\t\tnews. We realize that the constellation is actually the holes\n\tin the mouthpiece of a phone. Seen from inside. NEO (V. O. )\n\t\t\tI've decided to make a few\n\t\t\tchanges. We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone. He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,\n\twearing a long black coat and dark glasses. He passes a\n\tmother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --\n\n\tNeo takes off, flying up into the air. BOY\n\t\t\tMommy! Mommy! MOMMY\n\t\t\tWhat? BOY\n\t\t\tThat man! That man flies! MOMMY\n\t\t\tDon't be silly, honey. Men don't\n\t\t\tfly. There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots\n\toverhead.

We hear  wind\nas we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere. We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker\nworld of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real. The\nrotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach\na fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing\nbuzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity\nfrom the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as\nwe approach the fissure. WOMAN (V. O. )\n\n           \"Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em. \"\n\n                              MAN (V. O. )\n\n    \"I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it! \"\n\nWe hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police\nscanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora. NIOBE (V. O. )\n\n     \"Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One. '\"\n\n                              MAN (V. O. )\n\n             \"Oooh, our savior. Hed better be worth it. \"\n\n                             NIOBE (V. O. )\n\n                \"Shut up and make the exit. Hold on! \"\n\nThe azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming. A  tight\nconvoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling\nnearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into\nthe sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables. The  blue\nglow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the\nfirst and third hovercrafts. Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,\nis the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,\nslowing as they reach the top of the arc. NIOBE (V. O. )\n\n                             \"Woo-hoooh! \"\n\nThe rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails\nwildly between them. MAN (V. O. )\n\n                        \"They're still on us! \"\n\nMore vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours\nup onto the surface. INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT\n\nThe NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing\nbackwards. TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas\nAnderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from\nthem, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them. It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEOS POWERS   and\nthe defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the\ninterior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and\nstressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their\nknocked-out ship. MORPHEUS is on a headset. MORPHEUS\n\n                      \"Niobe, theyre closing. \"\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                             \"How many? \"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n              \"Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred. \"\n\n\nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT\n\nNIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship\nwith her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as\nthey streak over the dark surface. NIOBE\n\n               \"Youve got a gift for understatement. \"\n\n\nINT. FREEDOM COCKPIT\n\nTHE  FREEDOMS CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying\nblind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship. His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen. As she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT\ntattoo is conspicuous. They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass. MAN\n\n       \"Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em. \"\n\n                             NIOBE (V. O. )\n\n                             \"Too many! \"\n\n\nEXT. FREEDOM HULL\n\nA racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its\ncutting laser and ripping into the hull."

Her lieutenant looks back up to see a\nwing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship.

INT. NEB COCKPIT\n\nThe crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave\nthe scene of aerial carnage behind them. NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He\nrelaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters\na cave, and starts  to descend.

The artwork\nterminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more\nhospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles\nshe's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An\nunfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of\nloved ones. Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is\nsitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him\nwith her head on his lap. Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo\nof the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing\nas they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,\nEpoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an\nunknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the\nphoto. She awakens. TRINITY\n\n           \"I'll have to take that one down now.

Its  housed  poorly  lit,\nhouses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site. Crewpersons run\naround,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.

Another One? \"\n\n  DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking\n                              offscreen. DUJOUR\n\n          \"Idiot, we helped him find him.

Their clothes  are  homespun wool,\ndenim, and leather. Dyes and  color are absent. Carved into  the solid\ngranite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are\nintricate and beautiful carvings. NEO is lead down  the street by CHOI,  DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and  a few\nother rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity\nmelting into one race. CHOI\n\n\"See, man?

MOUNTAIN TOP, LATE DAY (CONSTRUCT)\n\nTRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It\nlooks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far\nas the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in\nthe sunset light. She looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind. A hand appears on her shoulder. Its NEO. How he got on the finger  of\nrock is anyones guess. NEO\n\n                                \"Boo. \"\n\nTRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm.

Hes on the very, very edge\nof the rock. He extends his  hand down to  her. She grabs  it, and he\nhauls her up. Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the\nfinger. TRINITY\n\n          \"In this construct program, the ground can kill. \"\n\n                                 NEO\n\n                    \"I wont let you fall. Ever. \"\n\nTHEY look  into each  others eyes. Despite the  trauma theyve  been\nthrough, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection. NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, as\nthough hes on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standing\nprecariously on  the edge,  wobbling a  bit as  she maintains  balance\nagainst  nerves. She  breathes  deep,  and  looks  back  up  at  NEO,\nmaintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle. NEO stands a few  feet away from her,  completely at ease as  the high\naltitude winds ruffle his hair. NEO extends a hand to her. NEO\n\n\"Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do\n                          it. You can, too. \"\n\n\nWith one last  glance at the  infinite drop, she  steadies herself and\nstares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she  steps\nstraight out. She takes one step in the  air. For a breathless second, as  she steps\noff the edge,  she is stable. When she takes  her foot off  the edge,\nthough, she sways,  and her foot  slips, as though  shes on a  greasy\nsurface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,\nsags further. TRINITY\n\n                               \"Shit. \"\n\nSHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil. NEO\n\n                              \"Whoops. \"\n\nHE  dives down,  shooting like  a missile. TRINITY is  calm, falling\nbackwards, watching NEO  come for her. The rocky ground  looms behind\nher. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE\nreaches for her with all his might. NEO\n\n                              \"Grab me! \"\n\nTRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is  seconds\naway. She stares at him intently. NEO\n\n                           \"Grab on to me! \"\n\nSEEING she is doing  nothing, he goes beneath  her and scoops her  up,\nSuperman  style. He  barely accomplishes  this  before  he slows  and\nsettles onto the rocky ground. They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains. NEO\n\n                   \"What the hell were you doing? \"\n\n         TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose. TRINITY\n\n                         \"Showing you, Neo. \"\n\n                                 NEO\n\n        \"Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack. \"\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n          \"I want you to know how much faith I have in you. \"\n\n                                 NEO\n\n              \"Oh. And this requires acts of insanity? \"\n\nTRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close. \"So, you really are Superman. \"\n\n                                 NEO\n\n                     \"Only when Im plugged in. \"\n\n TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He\n                              attempts a\n\n     kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek. NEO\n\n                               \"What? \"\n\n              TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky. TRINITY\n\n                   \"Its not you. Just, not here. \"\n\n           NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes. TRINITY\n\n  \"Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer\n                             geeks get? \"\n\n\nINT. MAIN BRIDGE\n\nCHOI,  RAZOR,  DUJOUR, and  CIRCA  are sitting  around  the operators\nconsole, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of  TRINITY\nand NEO standing together in  the GLADE. Its like theyre  watching a\nsoap opera. TRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction. ON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine. EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)\n\n                    TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm. TRINITY\n\n                             \"Over here. \"\n\n                   SHE leads him into the shadows. INT. MAIN BRIDGE\n\nTHE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear\noff the screen and into the darkness. RAZOR puts his hand on CIRCAS shoulder and sighs. RAZOR\n\n                            \"So romantic. \"\n\nCIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him. CIRCA\n\n    \"Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I. \"\n\n\nEXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)\n\nIN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively,  slowly,\nthen quicker as  they give in  to their feelings  for one another. WE\nmove around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout. INT."

GREGORY  pulls\na huge silver . 44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna  is\nblown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground\nwith a metallic clang. INT. CRUISER\n\nThe COP is  lying half-on the  seat, taking cover. The handset relays\nonly static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice. GREGORY\n\n  \"Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating\n                                ass. \"\n\n\nEXT. CRUISER\n\n                 The cop comes out with his hands up. COP\n\n                       \"Whaddya want with me? \"\n\n                               GREGORY\n\n\"I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you\n                shooting at me. So, what do you want? \"\n\nTHE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious. COP\n\n                      \"Youre all under arrest. \"\n\nTHE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and\ncircles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction. GREGORY\n\n \"This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off. \"\n\nCHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard\nliquour. CHANDRA\n\n                               \"Drink. \"\n\nWHEN  he  pauses,   GREGORY  places  the   gun  against  his   temple. Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol. GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle. GREGORY\n\n                    \"You never even saw us, man. \"\n\n                               CHANDRA\n\n                          \"Keep the bottle. \"\n\nTHEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of\nthe road. CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. BEACH\n\nA CAMPFIRE blazes only a few  feet away from the high tide. A billion\nstars shine overhead as GREGORY and his biker gang, including the cop,\nsit or  lie around  the fire. A few  people are  still awake, and one\npicks drunkenly at a guitar. GREGORY stands,  throws a  blanket over  his shoulder,  and scoops  up\nCHANDRA. They make their way into the dunes. EXT."

RAZORS fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys. Data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away. Finally, he  hits\nenter so hard it rocks the station. RAZOR  turns to  Circa as  Matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the\nscreens. RAZOR\n\n                      \"Yes! Did you like that? \"\n\n                      CIRCA just rolls her eyes. INT.

A police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders. EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET\n\nTHE Countach skids  to a stop,  kicking up a  massive dust cloud  that\nhides the  car. We  hear the  door slide,  and the  massive black-clad\nfigure of MORPHEUS emerges from the dust. An Uzi in each hand, pointed at US. THE COP behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even\nduck for cover. The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips  through\nit, chewing the cop to pieces. His body thrashes in the seat. MORPHEUS turns away. NIOBE pulls up on her bike and gets off,  slowly,\nobviously the ride had been  a long one. Trinity joins  them. Morpheus\nstops. MORPHEUS\n\n             \"I thought Razor said their were two cops. \"\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM HOUSE (MATRIX) - SUNSET\n\nA ROOKIE cop, his  face to young for  a razor, is shaking  as he peeks\nthrough a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists  who\njust wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his\nservice pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs. INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT\n\nRAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen. RAZOR\n\n                          \"Fuck, fuck fuck! \"\n\n\nEXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET\n\nTHEY smell somethings wrong. They  move, back to back in  a triangle,\nfor the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at\nonce. MORPHEUS\n\n                         \"Niobe, you first. \"\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n                      \"Bullshit, its my turn. \"\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                     \"Junior ranks leave first. \"\n\nTRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing. Its the moment Smith was waiting for. HE BURSTS  out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth. Inside, glass\nshatters, and blood sprays as  Trinity is riddled with bullets. Smith\ndoesnt stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,\nphone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth\ndoor as it shuts from her weight. INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)\n\nTRINITYS body spasms violently against her harness as her life  signs\ngo berserk. Shes not  dead, but  death is  only seconds  away. Circa\nscreams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity\nfrom which he derived his name. EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - NIGHT\n\nMORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his\nbody moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at\n him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and\nempty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground. MORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe. MORPHEUS\n\n                            \"Get her out. \"\n\nNIOBE dives for  the shattered booth,  kicking away the  starred glass\nand  answering  the  ringing  phone. She  pulls  it  down,  and hauls\nTrinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear. TRINITYS head merely sags lifelessly to one side. NIOBE\n\n      \"Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up! \"\n\nTRINITYS  eyes   flicker. She   focuses  on   Niobe,  summoning  her\nconsciousness enough to make the  phase back into the real  world. She\nstarts to fade as we cut to:\n\n\nINT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)\n\nCIRCA stands over  Trinity as the  rebels blue eyes  flutter open. Her\nwhole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs\nCirca. CIRCA\n\n                     \"Youre safe, youre safe! \"\n\n\nEXT. REST STOP\n\nMORPHEUS charges SMITH. Smith ignores reloads  him, and sights  in on\nthe exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone  back\non the  hook. As  the sights  rest right  between her shoulder blades,\nMorpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot,  the\naction freeze  back on  an empty  chamber, before  Morpheus throws his\nhands up in the air\n\nThe shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth. She\nhangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone  rings. She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they\nfight. She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight. INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT\n\nRAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen. RAZOR\n\n                           \"Crazy mothers! \"\n\nCIRCA has  removed Trinitys  interface, but  shes having  a seizure. Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the  cover\noff a wicked hypo. RAZOR\n\n                       \"Whats wrong with her? \"\n\n                                CIRCA\n\n             \"Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit. \"\n\nCIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest. EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX)\n\nMorpheus and  Smith clash  in the  dust -  punches, kicks,  and blocks\ncoming too  fast to  see. Smith  is wailing  on Morpheus, but Morpheus\nsneaks in a  kick that separates  them. They take  stances a good  two\ndistances away. Theyre about to go at it again when:\n\nNIOBE sprints  into the  fight. Performing  a flying  leap kick, Smith\ngrabs her  and swings  her down,  crashing her  body into the concrete\nwith a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus\nflies  back into  action, catching  the agent  with a  furious ass  of\nswinging kicks. Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they  assault\nthe agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will  capped\nby the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges. He  lands  a punch  into  Niobes stomach,  and  her body  folds  over\nunnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood\npouring from her mouth. MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  Smiths\nneck,  smashing  the  agents  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the\nconcrete. For a  moment, Smith is  still. Morpheus collects  Niobe and\nruns for the phone booth, which is still ringing. ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward. Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him  and\nstarts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face. SMITH\n\n          \"I should have killed you the first chance I had. \"\n\nLike an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final\nblow. But  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. He  flips\nback, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second\ntoo  slow to  cut the  agents head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanly\nthrough the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat. RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over\nMorpheus as  he pursues  the agent."
