                "text": "Preface\n    I'd never given much thought to how I would die — though I'd had reasonenough in the last few months — but even if I had, I would not haveimagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes ofthe hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone Iloved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it'snot reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. Chapter 1 First Sight\n      My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It wasseventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I waswearing my favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearingit as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small townnamed Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains onthis inconsequential town more than any other place in the United Statesof America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade thatmy mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was inthis town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until Iwas fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these pastthree summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for twoweeks instead. It was to Forks that I now exiled myself— an action that I took withgreat horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved thevigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me — the last of a thousand times — before I goton the plane. \"You don't have to do this. \"My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt aspasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leavemy loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course shehad Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be foodin the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she gotlost, but still…\"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been sayingthis lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi. \"\"I will. \"\"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted. \"You can come home whenever you want —I'll come right back as soon as you need me. \"But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise. \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged. \"It'll be great. I love you, Mom. \"She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and shewas gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a smallplane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I wasa little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemedgenuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first timewith any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for highschool and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyonewould call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. Iknew he was more than a little confused by my decision — like my motherbefore me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen— just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primarymotivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, wasthat I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lightson top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off theplane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automaticallycaught and steadied me. \"You haven't changed much. How's Renée? \"\"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad. \" I wasn't allowed to callhim Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable forWashington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winterwardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk ofthe cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we werestrapped in. \"What kind of car? \" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car foryou\" as opposed to just \"good car. \"\"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy. \"\"Where did you find it? \"\"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push? \" La Push is the tiny Indianreservation on the coast. \"No. \"\"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted. That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blockingpainful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"sohe can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap. \"\"What year is it? \" I could see from his change of expression that thiswas the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine — it's only a few yearsold, really. \"I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give upthat easily. \"When did he buy it? \"\"He bought it in 1984, I think. \"\"Did he buy it new? \"\"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties — or late fifties atthe earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch — Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able tofix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic…\"\"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like thatanymore. \"The thing, I thought to myself… it had possibilities — as a nickname, atthe very least. \"How cheap is cheap? \" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromiseon. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift. \"Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car. \"\f\"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here. \" He was looking ahead at theroad when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing hisemotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straightahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it. \" No need to addthat my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need tosuffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth — orengine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks. We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and thatwas pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green:\n　　the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with acanopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered downgreenly through the leaves. It was too green — an alien planet. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small,two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days oftheir marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had — theearly ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that neverchanged, was my new — well, new to me — truck. It was a faded red color,with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, Iloved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged —the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched,surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks! \" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be justthat much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of eitherwalking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in theChief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the westbedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it hadbeen belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light bluewalls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window —these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had evermade were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. Thedesk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modemstapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulationfrom my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chairfrom my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I wouldhave to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on thatfact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left mealone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogetherimpossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smileand look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at thesheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to goon a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have tothink about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred andfifty-seven — now fifty-eight — students; there were more than sevenhundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids herehad grown up together — their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to\fmy advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan,sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps — all thethings that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or redhair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but softsomehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eyecoordination to play sports without humiliating myself — and harming bothmyself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bagof bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myselfup after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as Ibrushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, butalready I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it wasvery clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all depended on color. Ihad no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that Iwas lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. Andif I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, whatwere my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn'trelate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to thananyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactlythe same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same thingsthrough my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. Allthat mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning. I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. Theconstant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fadeinto the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and lateradded the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight,when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I couldfeel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the skyhere; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck atschool. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended toavoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wifeand family."

                "text": "After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one ofthe three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its darkpaneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothingwas changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in anattempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplacein the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one ofthe three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpfulnurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to lastyear's. Those were embarrassing to look at — I would have to see what Icould do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I wasliving here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie hadnever gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the houseanymore. I donned my jacket — which had the feel of a biohazard suit —and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately asI reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by thedoor, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots wasunnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn'tpause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get outof the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under\fmy hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie hadobviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelledfaintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly,to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radioworked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was notobvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be theForks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matchinghouses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees andshrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of theinstitution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences,the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over thedoor reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure itwas off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead ofcircling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out ofthe toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with darkhedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door. Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office wassmall; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-fleckedcommercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clockticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if therewasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a longcounter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly coloredflyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, oneof which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She waswearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up. \"Can I help you? \"\"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awarenesslight her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter ofthe Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile ofdocuments on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for. \"Ihave your schedule right here, and a map of the school. \" She broughtseveral sheets to the counter to show roe. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to eachon the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was tobring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, likeCharlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back asconvincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad tosee that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At homeI'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were includedin the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a newMercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shinyVolvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in aspot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully Iwouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. Istuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, andsucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No onewas going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck. I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk,crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticedwith relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large\fblack \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt mybreathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached thedoor. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoatsthrough the door. The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just insidethe door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale,with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here. I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had anameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw myname — not an encouraging response — and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducingme to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me inthe back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the readinglist the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare,Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting… andboring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or ifshe would think that was cheating. I went through different argumentswith her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skinproblems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talkto me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you? \" He looked like the overly helpful,chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to lookat me. \"Where's your next class? \" he asked. I had to check in my bag. \"Um, Government, with Jefferson, in buildingsix. \"There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes. \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way…\" Definitelyover-helpful. \"I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively. \"Thanks. \"We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. Icould have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough toeavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh? \" he asked. \"Very. \"\"It doesn't rain much there, does it? \"\"Three or four times a year. \"\"Wow, what must that be like? \" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan. \"\"My mother is part albino. \"He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like cloudsand a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget howto use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle. \"Maybe we'll have\fsome other classes together. \" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside. The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometryteacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of thesubject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of theclass and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my ownboots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in eachclass. There was always someone braver than the others who wouldintroduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. Itried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I neverneeded the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with meto the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than myfive feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot ofthe difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so Ismiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn'ttry to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who sheintroduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy fromEnglish, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation withseven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from whereI sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren'ttalking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray ofuntouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike mostof the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear ofmeeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of thesethings that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big — muscledlike a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller,leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, lessbulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than theothers, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers hererather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had abeautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustratedswimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit onher self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden,gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike,thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black,cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale,the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler thanme, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hairtones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes — purplish, bruiselikeshadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almostdone recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all theirfeatures, were straight, perfect, angular. But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were alldevastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected tosee except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Orpainted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decidewho was the most beautiful — maybe the perfect blond girl, or thebronze-haired boy. They were all looking away — away from each other, away from the other\fstudents, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As Iwatched, the small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda, unbittenapple — and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on arunway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped hertray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thoughtpossible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they? \" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'dforgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant — though already knowing, probably,from my tone — suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyishone, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fractionof a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine."

In that brief flash of a glance,his face held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called his name,and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not toanswer. My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did. \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The onewho left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and hiswife. \" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now,picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was movingvery quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three stilllooked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I finally rememberedthat my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There weretwo girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are… very nice-looking. \" I struggled with the conspicuousunderstatement. \"Yes! \" Jessica agreed with another giggle. \"They're all together though —Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they livetogether. \" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the smalltown, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admitthat even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens? \" I asked. \"They don't look related…\"\"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or earlythirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins —the blondes — and they're foster children. \"\"They look a little old for foster children. \"\"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've beenwith Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or somethinglike that. \"\"That's really kind of nice — for them to take care of all those kidslike that, when they're so young and everything. \"\"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression thatshe didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glancesshe was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reasonwas jealousy. \"I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" sheadded, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again tothe table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at thewalls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks? \" I asked. Surely I would have noticed\fthem on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to anew arrival like me. \"They just moved down two years ago from somewherein Alaska. \"I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as theywere, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't theonly newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by anystandard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and metmy gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I lookedswiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmetexpectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair? \" I asked. I peeked athim from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but notgawking like the other students had today — he had a slightly frustratedexpression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. Hedoesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enoughfor him. \" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'dturned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face wasturned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he weresmiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. Theyall were noticeably graceful — even the big, brawny one. It wasunsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would haveif I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on myfirst day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded methat her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walkedto class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped labtable exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. Infact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, Irecognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that singleopen seat. As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get myslip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, hesuddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyeswith the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious. Ilooked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book inthe walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girlsitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense aboutintroductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he hadno choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by theantagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but Isaw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning awayfrom me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his facelike he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. Itsmelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed aninnocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making adark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd alreadystudied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of myhair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he neverrelaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far fromme as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into afist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he neverrelaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to hiselbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath hislight skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burlybrother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because theday was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tightfist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked likehe wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normalbehavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunchtoday. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought. It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve. I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring downat me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away fromhim, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenlyran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullenwas out of his seat. Fluidly he rose — he was much taller than I'dthought — his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else wasout of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. Itwasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block theanger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, mytemper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry,a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan? \" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefullygelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviouslydidn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike. \"\"Hi, Mike. \"\"Do you need any help finding your next class? \"\"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it. \"\"That's my next class, too. \" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't thatbig of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he supplied most of theconversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till hewas ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in myEnglish class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab EdwardCullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that. \"I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently,that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology? \" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said. \"He looked like he was in pain or something. \"\"I don't know,\" I responded. \"I never spoke to him. \"\f\"He's a weird guy. \" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to thedressing room. \"If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talkedto you. \"I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. Hewas friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease myirritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dressdown for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P. E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personalhell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering howmany injuries I had sustained — and inflicted — playing volleyball, Ifelt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return mypaperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, andcolder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walkedback out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again thattousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to befree. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked upthe gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biologyto another time — any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be somethingelse, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The lookon his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It wasimpossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense disliketo me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through theroom, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in thewire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened,and he turned slowly to glare at me — his face was absurdly handsome —with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill ofgenuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second,but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to thereceptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet. \"I can seethat it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help. \" And he turned onhis heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, andhanded her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear? \" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemedlike a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp greenhole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key andthe engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fightingtears the whole way there. Chapter 2 Open Book\n    The next day was better… and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were denseand opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day."

I peeked athim from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but notgawking like the other students had today — he had a slightly frustratedexpression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. Hedoesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enoughfor him. \" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'dturned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face wasturned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he weresmiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. Theyall were noticeably graceful — even the big, brawny one. It wasunsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would haveif I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on myfirst day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded methat her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walkedto class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped labtable exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. Infact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, Irecognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that singleopen seat. As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get myslip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, hesuddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyeswith the strangest expression on his face — it was hostile, furious. Ilooked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book inthe walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girlsitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black — coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense aboutintroductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he hadno choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by theantagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but Isaw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning awayfrom me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his facelike he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. Itsmelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed aninnocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making adark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd alreadystudied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of myhair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he neverrelaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far fromme as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into afist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he neverrelaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to hiselbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath hislight skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burlybrother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because theday was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tightfist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked likehe wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normalbehavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunchtoday. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought. It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve. I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring downat me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away fromhim, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenlyran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullenwas out of his seat. Fluidly he rose — he was much taller than I'dthought — his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else wasout of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. Itwasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block theanger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, mytemper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry,a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan? \" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefullygelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviouslydidn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike. \"\"Hi, Mike. \"\"Do you need any help finding your next class? \"\"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it. \"\"That's my next class, too. \" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't thatbig of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer — he supplied most of theconversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till hewas ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in myEnglish class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab EdwardCullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that. \"I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently,that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology? \" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said. \"He looked like he was in pain or something. \"\"I don't know,\" I responded. \"I never spoke to him. \"\f\"He's a weird guy. \" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to thedressing room. \"If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talkedto you. \"I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. Hewas friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease myirritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dressdown for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P. E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personalhell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering howmany injuries I had sustained — and inflicted — playing volleyball, Ifelt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return mypaperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, andcolder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walkedback out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again thattousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to befree. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked upthe gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biologyto another time — any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be somethingelse, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The lookon his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It wasimpossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense disliketo me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through theroom, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in thewire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened,and he turned slowly to glare at me — his face was absurdly handsome —with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill ofgenuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second,but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to thereceptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet. \"I can seethat it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help. \" And he turned onhis heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, andhanded her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear? \" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemedlike a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp greenhole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key andthe engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fightingtears the whole way there. Chapter 2 Open Book\n    The next day was better… and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were denseand opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day."

                "text": "He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush ofembarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance,his face held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called his name,and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not toanswer. My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did. \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The onewho left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and hiswife. \" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now,picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was movingvery quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three stilllooked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I finally rememberedthat my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There weretwo girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are… very nice-looking. \" I struggled with the conspicuousunderstatement. \"Yes! \" Jessica agreed with another giggle. \"They're all together though —Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they livetogether. \" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the smalltown, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admitthat even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens? \" I asked. \"They don't look related…\"\"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or earlythirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins —the blondes — and they're foster children. \"\"They look a little old for foster children. \"\"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've beenwith Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or somethinglike that. \"\"That's really kind of nice — for them to take care of all those kidslike that, when they're so young and everything. \"\"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression thatshe didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glancesshe was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reasonwas jealousy. \"I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" sheadded, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again tothe table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at thewalls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks? \" I asked. Surely I would have noticed\fthem on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to anew arrival like me. \"They just moved down two years ago from somewherein Alaska. \"I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as theywere, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't theonly newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by anystandard.

                "text": "Mikecame to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with ChessClub Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn'tlook at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group atlunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whosenames and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treadingwater, instead of drowning in it. It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the windechoing around the house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me inTrig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It wasmiserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn'tcringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all. All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of mewanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While Iwas lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But Iknew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. Imade the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator. But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica — trying to keep myeyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely — I saw thathis four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, andhe was not with them. Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated bythe attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried tolisten to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waitingnervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simplyignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false. He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, hestill hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a goldenretriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at thedoor, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to myseat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. Helingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfullyand went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like Iwas going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. Ina town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacywas essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practicedealing with overly friendly boys. I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. Itold myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the naggingsuspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, andegotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It wasimpossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true. When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of mycheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeansand navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased tofind that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. Iwalked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeingstudents. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I hadwhat I needed. Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides friedeggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for theduration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to thebanquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I hadmy shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD\fMONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned inmy direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars thatwere waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend thatthe earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the twoCullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny newVolvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before — I'd been toomesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that theywere all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtlyhinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the stylewith which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags andpulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money. But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. Itdidn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here. No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; Icouldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree ofbeauty. They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else. I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was freeof the school grounds. The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, offthe highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. Idid the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiartask gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear thetapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in whereverI could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrappedpotatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak inmarinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge. When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Beforestarting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damphair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I hadthree messages. \"Bella,\" my mom wrote…Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is itraining? I miss you already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, butI can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi. Mom. I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. \"Bella,\" she wrote…Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning. Isabella,If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p. m. today I'm calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for\fjumping the gun. Mom,Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. Bella. I sent that, and began again. Mom,Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for somethingto write about. School isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met somenice kids who sit by me at lunch. Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it upFriday. Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, butreally sturdy, which is good, you know, for me. I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check mye-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe. I love you. Bella. I had decided to read Wuthering Heights — the novel we were currentlystudying in English — yet again for the fun of it, and that's what I wasdoing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I hurrieddownstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. \"Bella? \" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself. \"Hey, Dad, welcome home. \"\"Thanks. \" He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as Ibustled about the kitchen. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gunon the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he wouldalways remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess heconsidered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and notdepressed enough to shoot myself on purpose. \"What's for dinner? \" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook,and her experiments weren't always edible. I was surprised, and sad, thathe seemed to remember that far back. \"Steak and potatoes,\" I answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; helumbered into the living room to watch TV while I worked. We were bothmore comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks cooked, andset the table. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively ashe walked into the room. \"Smells good, Bell. \"\"Thanks. \"We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of\fus was bothered by the quiet. In some ways, we were well suited forliving together. \"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends? \" he asked as hewas taking seconds. \"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with herfriends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice. \" With one outstanding exception. \"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid — nice family. His dad owns thesporting goods store just outside of town. He makes a good living off allthe backpackers who come through here. \"\"Do you know the Cullen family? \" I asked hesitantly. \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man. \"\"They… the kids… are a little different. They don't seem to fit in verywell at school. \"Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered. \"Dr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeonwho could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times thesalary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder. \"We're lucky to havehim — lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an assetto the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. Ihad my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adoptedteenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they'reall very mature — I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have livedin this town for generations. And they stick together the way a familyshould — camping trips every other weekend… Just because they'renewcomers, people have to talk. \"It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feelstrongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled. \"They seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they keptto themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be morecomplimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing. \"It's a good thinghe's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hardtime concentrating on their work with him around. \"We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the tablewhile I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after Ifinished washing the dishes by hand — no dishwasher — I went upstairsunwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in themaking. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of myclasses. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all thestudents at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass methe ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried totake advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered thecafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtimeconversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Parkin two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I hadagreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hotand dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, nolonger worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped\fout of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totallysuppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence,ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused tospending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. Icleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom morebogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it wasso poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have tomake a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. Iwondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got… and shuddered atthe thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know alltheir names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone."

He makes a good living off allthe backpackers who come through here. \"\"Do you know the Cullen family? \" I asked hesitantly. \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man. \"\"They… the kids… are a little different. They don't seem to fit in verywell at school. \"Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered. \"Dr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeonwho could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times thesalary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder. \"We're lucky to havehim — lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an assetto the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. Ihad my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adoptedteenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they'reall very mature — I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have livedin this town for generations. And they stick together the way a familyshould — camping trips every other weekend… Just because they'renewcomers, people have to talk. \"It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feelstrongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled. \"They seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they keptto themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be morecomplimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing. \"It's a good thinghe's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hardtime concentrating on their work with him around. \"We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the tablewhile I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after Ifinished washing the dishes by hand — no dishwasher — I went upstairsunwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in themaking. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of myclasses. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all thestudents at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass methe ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried totake advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered thecafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtimeconversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Parkin two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I hadagreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hotand dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, nolonger worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped\fout of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totallysuppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence,ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused tospending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. Icleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom morebogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it wasso poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have tomake a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. Iwondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got… and shuddered atthe thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know alltheir names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone."

                "text": "It was colder thismorning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomedseat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It wasstraightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought Iwould feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected tofeel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at mycheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said. \"It's snowing. \"I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along thesidewalk and swirling erratically past my face. \"Ew. \" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised. \"Don't you like snow? \"\"No. That means it's too cold for rain. \" Obviously. \"Besides, I thoughtit was supposed to come down in flakes — you know, each one unique andall that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips. \"\"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before? \" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have. \" I paused. \"On TV. \"Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked intothe back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had mysuspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us — in thewrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay? \" I kept walking as I spoke. \"Once peoplestart throwing wet stuff, I go inside. \"He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow;apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouthshut. Sure, it was drier than rain — until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush ballswere flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as ashield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in myexpression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with icemelting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedlyabout the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward thattable in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. Therewere five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want? \"I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious,I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella? \" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered. \"I'll just get a soda today. \" I caught up to theend of the line. \"Aren't you hungry? \" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table,my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, withunnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up andescape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away. I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If hewas glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them werelooking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hairentirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning awayas Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying thesnowy day, just like everyone else — only they looked more like a scenefrom a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was somethingdifferent, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. Iexamined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided —flushed from the snow fight maybe — the circles under his eyes much lessnoticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying toisolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at? \" Jessica intruded, her eyes following mystare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure,though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh orunfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curiousagain, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he? \" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question. \"Should he be? \"\"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put myhead down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody… well, they don't notice anybody enoughto like them. But he's still staring at you. \"\"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make surethat she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then — he was planning an epic battle of the blizzardin the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreedenthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that shewould be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have tohide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my owntable. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since hedidn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightenedlittle flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual — he seemed tobe a popular target for the snowball snipers — but when we went to thedoor, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing alltraces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of thewalkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to gostraight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was stillempty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing onemicroscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a fewminutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away fromthe door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayedcarefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as faraway from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. Hishair was dripping wet, disheveled — even so, he looked like he'd justfinished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face wasfriendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes werecareful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued. \"I didn't have a chance tointroduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan. \"My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? Hewas perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn'tthink of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name? \" I stammered. He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting foryou to arrive. \"I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly. \"I meant, why did you call me Bella? \"He seemed confused. \"Do you prefer Isabella? \"\"No, I like Bella,\" I said. \"But I think Charlie — I mean my dad — mustcall me Isabella behind my back — that's what everyone here seems to knowme as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh. \" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly. Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried toconcentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slidesin the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separatethe slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis theyrepresented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use ourbooks. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had itright. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner? \" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling acrooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish. \" The smile faded; he was obviouslywondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing. \"I'll go ahead. \"I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knewwhat I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide intoplace under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident. \"Prophase. \"\"Do you mind if I look? \" he asked as I began to remove the slide. Hishand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold,like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn'twhy I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung myhand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, hecontinued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, ashe examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on ourworksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, andthen glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke. I kept my voice indifferent. \"May I? \"He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it,he was right. \"Slide three? \" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch myskin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase. \" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. Hetook a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it whilehe looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want tospoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and hispartner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had theirbook open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him…unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that sameinexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified thatsubtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts? \" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question. \"No. \"\"Oh,\" I mumbled. \"I thought there was something different about youreyes. \"He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered\fthe flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me — thecolor was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburnhair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher,darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn'tunderstand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason aboutthe contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense ofthe word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. Helooked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then staredmore intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with themicroscope? \" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically. \"Actually, she identified threeof the five. \"Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before? \" he asked. I smiled sheepishly. \"Not with onion root. \"\"Whitefish blastula? \"\"Yeah. \"Mr. Banner nodded. \"Were you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix? \"\"Yes. \"\"Well,\" he said after a moment, \"I guess it's good you two are labpartners. \" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, Ibegan doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it? \" Edward asked. I had the feelingthat he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia sweptover me again."

I was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling ofsuspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. \"You don't like the cold. \" It wasn't a question. \"Or the wet. \"\"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,\" he mused. \"You have no idea,\" I muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any morethan courtesy absolutely demanded. \"Why did you come here, then? \"No one had asked me that — not straight out like he did, demanding. \"It's… complicated. \"\"I think I can keep up,\" he pressed. I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting hisgaze. His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenlysympathetic. \"When did that happen? \"\"Last September. \" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough. \"\"Why didn't you stay with them? \"I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me withpenetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitallyimportant. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living. \" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him? \" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He movesaround a lot. \"\"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him. \" Hesaid it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction. \"No, she did not send me here. I sent myself. \"His eyebrows knit together. \"I don't understand,\" he admitted, and heseemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at mewith obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy… soI decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie. \" My voicewas glum by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out. \"And? \" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair. \" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor. \"Hasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair. \"\"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at methat way. His gaze became appraising. \"You put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyonesee. \"I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like afive-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong? \"I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured smugly. \"Why does it matter to you? \" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away,watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered ifhe was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, Idecided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you? \" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking… and told the truth again. \"Notexactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read — mymother always calls me her open book. \" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read. \" Despite everythingthat I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually. \" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief tolisten. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to thisbizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemedengrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of myeye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edgeof the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, withtransparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen withoutdifficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefullyfrom the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I staredafter him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imaginedhim with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned. \"They all looked exactly the same. You'relucky you had Cullen for a partner. \"\"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. Iregretted the snub instantly. \"I've done the lab before, though,\" I addedbefore he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged intoour raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent. \"I wonder what was with him last Monday. \"I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so mywoolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my teamducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I washappier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once notcaring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket,put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dryit on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed thestill, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door ofthe Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting arusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on thebrake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrapmetal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of mycar, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I staredstraight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I wouldswear I saw him laughing. Chapter 3 Phenomenon\n    When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different. It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day inthe forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fogveiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, andwhitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain fromyesterday had frozen solid — coating the needles on the trees infantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it mightbe safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways,living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myselfreveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from thecarton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew itwasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeingmy new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I waseager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that wasvery, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassingbabbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie abouthis eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes feltemanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured hisperfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheresthat did not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brickdriveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck,but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, todaywas going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and myunwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike andEric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to mehere. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe itwas just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through allthe awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few andfar between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearingrather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever thereason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with himwere disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored. My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered theroads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path ofdestruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so littletrouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of thetruck — carefully holding the side for support — to examine my tires. There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, andCharlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise. I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight backthe sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heardan odd sound. It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. Ilooked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion,the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed tomake my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detailseveral things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me inhorror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the samemask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue vanthat was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes,spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hitthe back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn'teven have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around thetruck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I wasexpecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt somethingsolid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavementbehind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance tonotice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curledgratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding,was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice wasimpossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectivelyin front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, thelarge hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of thevan's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly grippingunder the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging mylegs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. Agroaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping,onto the asphalt — exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low,frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right? \"\"I'm fine. \" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized hewas holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head prettyhard. \"I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"Ow,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought. \" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he wassuppressing laughter. \"How in the…\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?"

                "text": "\"\"I was standing right next to you, Bella,\" he said, his tone seriousagain. I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around mywaist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. Ilooked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again bythe force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down theirfaces, shouting at each other, shouting at us. \"Don't move,\" someone instructed. \"Get Tyler out of the van! \" someone else shouted. There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward'scold hand pushed my shoulder down. \"Just stay put for now. \"\"But it's cold,\" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under hisbreath. There was an edge to the sound. \"You were over there,\" I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stoppedshort. \"You were by your car. \"His expression turned hard. \"No, I wasn't. \"\"I saw you. \" All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices ofadults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument;I was right, and he was going to admit it. \"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way. \" Heunleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying tocommunicate something crucial. \"No. \" I set my jaw. The gold in his eyes blazed. \"Please, Bella. \"\"Why? \" I demanded. \"Trust me,\" he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I could hear the sirens now. \"Will you promise to explain everything tome later? \"\"Fine,\" he snapped, abruptly exasperated. \"Fine,\" I repeated angrily. It took six EMTs and two teachers — Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp — to shiftthe van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edwardvehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor toldthem I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died ofhumiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entireschool was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of theambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening. To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safelyaway. \"Bella! \" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. \"I'm completely fine, Char — Dad,\" I sighed. \"There's nothing wrong withme. \"He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out toconsider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in myhead. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dentin the tan car's bumper — a very distinct dent that fit the contours ofEdward's shoulders… as if he had braced himself against the car withenough force to damage the metal frame…And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, withexpressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint ofconcern for their brother's safety. I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had justseen — a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. Ifelt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worsewas that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his ownpower. I ground my teeth together. They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds\fseparated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on myarm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling thecurtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated towear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, Iquickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher broughtto the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Governmentclass beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head. Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staringanxiously at me. \"Bella, I'm so sorry! \"\"I'm fine, Tyler — you look awful, are you all right? \" As we spoke,nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallowslices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. \"I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast,and I hit the ice wrong…\" He winced as one nurse started dabbing at hisface. \"Don't worry about it; you missed me. \"\"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then youwere gone…\"\"Umm… Edward pulled me out of the way. \"He looked confused. \"Who? \"\"Edward Cullen — he was standing next to me. \" I'd always been a terribleliar; I didn't sound convincing at all. \"Cullen? I didn't see him… wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay? \"\"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use astretcher. \"I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explainaway what I'd seen. They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there wasnothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I couldleave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I wastrapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies andpromises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried toconvince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, Iclosed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. \"Is she sleeping? \" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. Itwasn't easy — it would have been more natural to ogle. \"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry —\" Tyler began. Edward lifted a hand to stop him. \"No blood, no foul,\" he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved tosit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing me. He smirked again. \"So, what's the verdict? \" he asked me. \"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,\" Icomplained. \"How come you aren't strapped to a gurney like the rest ofus? \"\"It's all about who you know,\" he answered. \"But don't worry, I came tospring you. \"Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was\fyoung, he was blond… and he was handsomer than any movie star I'd everseen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under hiseyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. \"So, Miss Swan,\" Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, \"howare you feeling? \"\"I'm fine,\" I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. \"Your X-rays look good,\" he said. \"Does your head hurt? Edward said youhit it pretty hard. \"\"It's fine,\" I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed whenI winced. \"Tender? \" he asked. \"Not really. \" I'd had worse. I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. Myeyes narrowed. \"Well, your father is in the waiting room — you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight atall. \"\"Can't I go back to school? \" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to beattentive. \"Maybe you should take it easy today. \"I glanced at Edward. \"Does he get to go to school? \"\"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,\" Edward saidsmugly. \"Actually,\" Dr. Cullen corrected, \"most of the school seems to be in thewaiting room. \"\"Oh no,\" I moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. \"Do you want to stay? \"\"No, no! \" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed andhopping down quickly. Too quickly — I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caughtme. He looked concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problemshad nothing to do with hitting my head. \"Take some Tylenol for the pain,\" he suggested as he steadied me. \"It doesn't hurt that bad,\" I insisted. \"It sounds like you were extremely lucky,\" Dr. Cullen said, smiling as hesigned my chart with a flourish. \"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,\" I amended with a hardglance at the subject of my statement. \"Oh, well, yes,\" Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers infront of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,\"he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. \"Can I talk to you for a minute? \" I hissed under my breath. He took astep back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. \"Your father is waiting for you,\" he said through his teeth. I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. \"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,\" I pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. Inearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into ashort hallway, he spun around to face me. \"What do you want? \" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severitythan I'd intended. \"You owe me an explanation,\" I reminded him. \"I saved your life — I don't owe you anything. \"I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. \"You promised. \"\"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about. \" Histone was cutting. My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. \"There's nothingwrong with my head. \"He glared back. \"What do you want from me, Bella? \"\"I want to know the truth,\" I said. \"I want to know why I'm lying foryou. \"\"What do you think happened? \" he snapped. It came out in a rush. \"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me — Tyler didn't see you,either, so don't tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going tocrush us both — and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side ofit — and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all —and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up…\" Icould hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad Icould feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding myteeth together. He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. \"You think I lifted a van off you? \" His tone questioned my sanity, but itonly made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by askilled actor. I merely nodded once, jaw tight. \"Nobody will believe that, you know. \" His voice held an edge of derisionnow. \"I'm not going to tell anybody. \" I said each word slowly, carefullycontrolling my anger. Surprise flitted across his face. \"Then why does it matter? \"\"It matters to me,\" I insisted. \"I don't like to lie — so there'd betterbe a good reason why I'm doing it. \"\"Can't you just thank me and get over it? \"\"Thank you. \" I waited, fuming and expectant. \"You're not going to let it go, are you? \"\f\"No. \"\"In that case… I hope you enjoy disappointment. \"We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying tokeep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid,glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. \"Why did you even bother? \" I asked frigidly. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedlyvulnerable. \"I don't know,\" he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I couldwalk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed likeevery face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to myside; I put up my hands. \"There's nothing wrong with me,\" I assured him sullenly. I was stillaggravated, not in the mood for chitchat. \"What did the doctor say? \"\"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home. \" Isighed."

                "text": "Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to convergeon us. \"Let's go,\" I urged. Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me tothe glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping toconvey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief— thefirst time I'd ever felt that way — to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barelyknew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's defensive behaviorin the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardlybelieve I'd witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. \"Um… you'll need to call Renée. \" He hung his head, guilty. I was appalled. \"You told Mom! \"\"Sorry. \"I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine atleast thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home— forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment — but her pleaswere easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by themystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edwardhimself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as Ishould be, as any normal, sane person would be. I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continuedto watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on myway to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as thepain eased, I drifted to sleep. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen. Chapter 4 Invitations\n    In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to beradiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back ashe walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast Iran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he neverturned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleepagain for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in mydreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never withinreach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first,embarrassing. To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of thatweek. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed withmaking amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted morethan anything else was for him to forget all about it — especially sincenothing had actually happened to me — but he remained insistent. Hefollowed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mikeand Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other,which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and overthat he was the hero — how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearlybeen crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, andeveryone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there tillthe van was pulled away. I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away,before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, Irealized the probable cause — no one else was as aware of Edward as Ialways was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for hisfirsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Halessat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only amongthemselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore. When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow,he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when hisfists would suddenly ball up — skin stretched even whiter over the bones— did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared. He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van — there was noother conclusion I could come to. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident Itried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been sofurious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, eventhough I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had infact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heatof my anger faded into awed gratitude. He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. Isat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that herealized I was there. \"Hello, Edward,\" I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behavemyself. He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, noddedonce, and then looked the other way. And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, afoot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stopmyself— from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. Iwatched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But inclass I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I\fwas miserable. And the dreams continued. Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Renée to mydepression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince herit was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my labpartner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue mighthave impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have theopposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my tableto talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as heignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mikewas disappointed he'd never gotten to stage his snowball fight, butpleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continuedheavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon — shecalled the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike tothe girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. \"Are you sure you don't mind… you weren't planning to ask him? \" shepersisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. \"No, Jess, I'm not going,\" I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outsidemy range of abilities. \"It will be really fun. \" Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. Isuspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than myactual company. \"You have fun with Mike,\" I encouraged. The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing selfin Trig and Spanish. She was silent as she walked by my side betweenclasses, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, Iwas the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mikeas possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet. Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look onhis face a bad sign. But he didn't broach the subject until I was in myseat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was electrically awareof Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merelyan invention of my imagination. \"So,\" Mike said, looking at the floor, \"Jessica asked me to the springdance. \"\"That's great. \" I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. \"You'll have alot of fun with Jessica. \"\"Well…\" He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with myresponse. \"I told her I had to think about it. \"\"Why would you do that? \" I let disapproval color my tone, though I wasrelieved he hadn't given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. \"I was wondering if… well, if you might be planning to ask me. \"I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively inmy direction. \"Mike, I think you should tell her yes,\" I said. \"Did you already ask someone? \" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyesflickered in his direction? \"No,\" I assured him. \"I'm not going to the dance at all. \"\"Why not? \" Mike demanded. I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so Iquickly made new plans. \"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,\" I explained. I needed to get out oftown anyway — it was suddenly the perfect time to go. \"Can't you go some other weekend? \"\"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer — it'srude. \"\"Yeah, you're right,\" he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back tohis seat. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, tryingto push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking. I sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge offrustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But insteadhe continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was noquestion of me looking away. My hands started to shake. \"Mr. Cullen? \" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that Ihadn't heard. \"The Krebs Cycle,\" Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned tolook at Mr. Banner. I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to findmy place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder tohide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me —just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in ahalf-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influenceover me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and,since that was impossible, at least not to let him know that I was awareof him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather mythings, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. \"Bella? \" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd knownthe sound of it all my life rather than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I wouldfeel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My expression was wary when Ifinally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. He didn't sayanything. \"What? Are you speaking to me again? \" I finally asked, an unintentionalnote of petulance in my voice. His lips twitched, fighting a smile. \"No, not really,\" he admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I wasgritting my teeth. He waited. \"Then what do you want, Edward? \" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it waseasier to talk to him coherently that way. \"I'm sorry. \" He sounded sincere. \"I'm being very rude, I know. But it'sbetter this way, really. \"I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said, my voice guarded. \"It's better if we're not friends,\" he explained. \"Trust me. \"My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. \"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,\" I hissed through myteeth. \"You could have saved yourself all this regret. \"\"Regret? \" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. \"Regretfor what? \"\"For not just letting that stupid van squish me. \"He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. \"You think I regret savingyour life? \"\"I know you do,\" I snapped. \"You don't know anything. \" He was definitely mad. I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all thewild accusations I wanted to hurl at him. I gathered my books together,then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out ofthe room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb anddropped my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leavingthem. Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was there; he'd alreadystacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. \"Thank you,\" I said icily. His eyes narrowed. \"You're welcome,\" he retorted. I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off toGym without looking back. Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me theball, so that was good, but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took peoplewith me. Today I was worse than usual because my head was so filled withEdward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back intomy thoughts just when I really needed my balance. It was a relief, as always, to leave."

I'd had to replace the taillights, and ifI'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parentshad to sell their van for parts. I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, darkfigure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was justEric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella. \"\"What's up? \" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't payingattention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words tookme by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering… if you would go to the spring dance with me? \"His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you forasking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day. \"\f\"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time. \"\"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take thattoo literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward,his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside,slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly andreversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spacesdown, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stoppedthere — to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking thisway, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of hisshiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearviewmirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowleywas in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated toacknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front ofme, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it wasTyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was stillrunning, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the windowdown. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen. \" I was annoyed — obviouslythe holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know — I just wanted to ask you something while we're trappedhere. \" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance? \" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler. \" My voice sounded a little sharp. Ihad to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already usedup my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why —\"He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy. \"Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am goingout of town. \"\"That's cool. We still have prom. \"And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feelthe shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, andJasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyeswere on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heardevery word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal… onelittle bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly,carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It wasa long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering theonions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, butit might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school toaccept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. Shehad to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested— with casual innocence — that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology\fwith me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had alwaysignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was stillavailable. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure ofMike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go tothe dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner — dicing the chickenespecially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. Butmy head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spokentoday. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends? My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see howabsorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on… so we couldn'teven be friends… because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging— a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting… and brilliant… and mysterious… and perfect… and beautiful…and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. Iwould get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and thenhopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offerme a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm treesas I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the greenpeppers. I couldn't blame him — the closest edible Mexican food wasprobably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just asmall-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemedto like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in thekitchen. \"Dad? \" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella? \"\"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the daya week from Saturday… if that's okay? \" I didn't want to ask permission —it set a bad precedent — but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why? \" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine somethingthat Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books — the library here is pretty limited —and maybe look at some clothes. \" I had more money than I was used tohaving, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not thatthe truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoingmy thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia — and Tacoma if I have to. \"\"Are you going all by yourself? \" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he wassuspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes. \"\"Seattle is a big city — you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle — and I can read a map,don't worry about it. \"\"Do you want me to come with you? \"I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day —very boring. \"\"Oh, okay. \" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any\fperiod of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks. \" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance? \"Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high schooldances were. \"No — I don't dance, Dad. \" He, of all people, should understand that — Ididn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberatelyparked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to putmyself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddleat my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed itbefore I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me,leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that? \" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what? \" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, hedropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air. \"\"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant. \" Hisvoice was quiet as usual — velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep,golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangledthoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night? \" I demanded, still looking away. \"Ithought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritatingme to death. \"\"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance. \" Hesnickered. \"You…\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like theheat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed moreamused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't dothe job? \"Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, allsigns of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled — I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised atmyself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and startedto walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. Buthe was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm notsaying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway. \"\"Why won't you leave me alone? \" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. Heseemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder? \" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again. \"I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask? \"\"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday — you know, the day of thespring dance —\"\"Are you trying to be funny? \" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. Myface got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish? \"I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so Icouldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wonderingif you wanted a ride. \"That was unexpected. \"What? \" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle? \"\"With who? \" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously. \" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talkingto someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why? \"\"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to behonest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it. \"\"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern. \" Istarted to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same levelof anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas? \" He matched my paceagain. \"I don't see how that is any of your business. \" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business. \"\"Honestly, Edward. \" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, andI hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be myfriend. \"\"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't wantto be. \"\"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up. \" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I hadstopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roofnow, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't helpmy clarity of thought. \"It would be more… prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained. \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella. \"His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, hisvoice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle? \" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned."

I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, darkfigure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was justEric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella. \"\"What's up? \" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't payingattention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words tookme by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering… if you would go to the spring dance with me? \"His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you forasking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day. \"\f\"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time. \"\"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take thattoo literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward,his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside,slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly andreversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spacesdown, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stoppedthere — to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking thisway, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of hisshiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearviewmirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowleywas in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated toacknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front ofme, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it wasTyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was stillrunning, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the windowdown. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen. \" I was annoyed — obviouslythe holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know — I just wanted to ask you something while we're trappedhere. \" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance? \" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler. \" My voice sounded a little sharp. Ihad to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already usedup my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why —\"He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy. \"Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am goingout of town. \"\"That's cool. We still have prom. \"And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feelthe shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, andJasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyeswere on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heardevery word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal… onelittle bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly,carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It wasa long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering theonions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, butit might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school toaccept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. Shehad to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested— with casual innocence — that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology\fwith me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had alwaysignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was stillavailable. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure ofMike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go tothe dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner — dicing the chickenespecially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. Butmy head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spokentoday. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends? My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see howabsorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on… so we couldn'teven be friends… because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging— a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting… and brilliant… and mysterious… and perfect… and beautiful…and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. Iwould get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and thenhopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offerme a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm treesas I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the greenpeppers. I couldn't blame him — the closest edible Mexican food wasprobably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just asmall-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemedto like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in thekitchen. \"Dad? \" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella? \"\"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the daya week from Saturday… if that's okay? \" I didn't want to ask permission —it set a bad precedent — but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why? \" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine somethingthat Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books — the library here is pretty limited —and maybe look at some clothes. \" I had more money than I was used tohaving, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not thatthe truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoingmy thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia — and Tacoma if I have to. \"\"Are you going all by yourself? \" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he wassuspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes. \"\"Seattle is a big city — you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle — and I can read a map,don't worry about it. \"\"Do you want me to come with you? \"I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day —very boring. \"\"Oh, okay. \" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any\fperiod of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks. \" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance? \"Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high schooldances were. \"No — I don't dance, Dad. \" He, of all people, should understand that — Ididn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberatelyparked as far as possible from the silver Volvo.

I wasn't payingattention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words tookme by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering… if you would go to the spring dance with me? \"His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you forasking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day. \"\f\"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time. \"\"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take thattoo literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward,his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside,slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly andreversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spacesdown, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stoppedthere — to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking thisway, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of hisshiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearviewmirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowleywas in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated toacknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front ofme, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it wasTyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was stillrunning, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the windowdown. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen. \" I was annoyed — obviouslythe holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know — I just wanted to ask you something while we're trappedhere. \" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance? \" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler. \" My voice sounded a little sharp. Ihad to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already usedup my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why —\"He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy. \"Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am goingout of town. \"\"That's cool. We still have prom. \"And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feelthe shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, andJasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyeswere on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heardevery word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal… onelittle bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly,carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It wasa long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering theonions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, butit might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school toaccept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. Shehad to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested— with casual innocence — that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology\fwith me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had alwaysignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was stillavailable. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure ofMike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go tothe dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner — dicing the chickenespecially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. Butmy head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spokentoday. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends? My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see howabsorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on… so we couldn'teven be friends… because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging— a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting… and brilliant… and mysterious… and perfect… and beautiful…and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. Iwould get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and thenhopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offerme a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm treesas I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the greenpeppers. I couldn't blame him — the closest edible Mexican food wasprobably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just asmall-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemedto like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in thekitchen. \"Dad? \" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella? \"\"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the daya week from Saturday… if that's okay? \" I didn't want to ask permission —it set a bad precedent — but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why? \" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine somethingthat Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books — the library here is pretty limited —and maybe look at some clothes. \" I had more money than I was used tohaving, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not thatthe truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoingmy thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia — and Tacoma if I have to. \"\"Are you going all by yourself? \" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he wassuspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes. \"\"Seattle is a big city — you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle — and I can read a map,don't worry about it. \"\"Do you want me to come with you? \"I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day —very boring. \"\"Oh, okay. \" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any\fperiod of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks. \" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance? \"Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high schooldances were. \"No — I don't dance, Dad. \" He, of all people, should understand that — Ididn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberatelyparked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to putmyself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddleat my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed itbefore I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me,leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that? \" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what? \" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, hedropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air. \"\"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant. \" Hisvoice was quiet as usual — velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep,golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangledthoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night? \" I demanded, still looking away. \"Ithought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritatingme to death. \"\"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance. \" Hesnickered. \"You…\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like theheat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed moreamused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't dothe job? \"Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, allsigns of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled — I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised atmyself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and startedto walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. Buthe was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm notsaying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway. \"\"Why won't you leave me alone? \" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. Heseemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder? \" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again. \"I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask? \"\"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday — you know, the day of thespring dance —\"\"Are you trying to be funny? \" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. Myface got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish? \"I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so Icouldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wonderingif you wanted a ride. \"That was unexpected. \"What? \" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle? \"\"With who? \" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously. \" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talkingto someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why? \"\"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to behonest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it. \"\"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern. \" Istarted to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same levelof anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas? \" He matched my paceagain. \"I don't see how that is any of your business. \" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business. \"\"Honestly, Edward. \" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, andI hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be myfriend. \"\"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't wantto be. \"\"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up. \" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I hadstopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roofnow, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't helpmy clarity of thought. \"It would be more… prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained. \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella. \"His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, hisvoice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle? \" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned."

                "text": "\"I'll see you in class. \"\fHe turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come. Chapter 5 Blood Type\n    I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I firstwalked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparagingtone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in hisusual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both metme at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mikeseemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as hetalked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposedto take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. Itried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It washard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if wewere lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believethat I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyeshad looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confusedwith reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed tohim on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold,indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by somemiracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessicababbled on and on about her dance plans — Lauren and Angela had asked theother boys and they were all going together — completely unaware of myinattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on histable. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? Ifollowed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lostmy appetite — I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted togo sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breakingthrough my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alonetoday. \"My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly,staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where heusually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motionedwith his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, hewinked. \"Does he mean you? \" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in hervoice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for herbenefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants. \"I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him,unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today? \" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was stillsmiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and Iwould wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well…\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"Idecided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly. \"I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know. \" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think yourfriends are angry with me for stealing you. \"\"They'll survive. \" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in hiseyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried. \"\"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually…what brought all this on? \"\"I told you — I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm givingup. \" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up? \" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes — giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now,and let the chips fall where they may. \" His smile faded as he explained,and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again. \"The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you — that's one of theproblems. \"\"Don't worry — I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that. \"\"So, in plain English, are we friends now? \"\"Friends…\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now thatI'm not a good friend for you. \" Behind his smile, the warning was real. \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling inmy stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you tobelieve it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me. \"\"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear,too. \" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being… not smart, we'll try to be friends? \" Istruggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right. \"I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not surewhat to do now. \"What are you thinking? \" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual,blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are. \"His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that? \" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories? \"I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between BruceWayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me? \" he asked, tilting his head to one side with ashockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing. \"\"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why thatwould be frustrating at all — just because someone refuses to tell youwhat they're thinking, even if all the while they're making crypticlittle remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wonderingwhat they could possibly mean… now, why would that be frustrating? \"He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"saythat person also did a wide range of bizarre things — from saving yourlife under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariahthe next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after hepromised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating. \"\"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you? \"\"I don't like double standards. \"We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What? \"\"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you — he'sdebating whether or not to come break up our fight. \" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sureyou're wrong, anyway. \"\"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read. \"\"Except me, of course. \"\"Yes. Except for you. \" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turnedbrooding. \"I wonder why that is. \"I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated onunscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table\fwithout seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry? \" he asked, distracted. \"No. \" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full — ofbutterflies. \"You? \" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry. \" I didn't understand his expression — it looked likehe was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor? \" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want. \"\"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered… if you could warn me beforehand the next time youdecide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared. \" I looked atthe lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with mypinkie finger. \"That sounds fair. \" He was pressing his lips together to keep fromlaughing when I looked up. \"Thanks. \"\"Then can I have one answer in return? \" he demanded. \"One. \"\"Tell me one theory. \"Whoops. \"Not that one. \"\"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory — I won't laugh. \"\"Yes, you will. \" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes,his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please? \" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what? \" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory. \" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider? \" Was he a hypnotist, too? Orwas I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders? \"\"Nope. \"\"And no radioactivity? \"\"None. \"\f\"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember? \"He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try. \" He was serious again. \"Because… ? \"\"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy? \" He smiledplayfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"Isee. \"\"Do you? \" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'daccidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous? \" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitivelyrealized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying totell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe thatyou're bad. \"\"You're wrong. \" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealingmy bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. Istared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he wassaying — that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge… and, morethan anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I wasnear him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late. \"\"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it wasjust a blur. \"Why not? \"\"It's healthy to ditch class now and then. \" He smiled up at me, but hiseyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk gettingcaught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later,then. \"I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door— with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many newquestions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settledquickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He wasjuggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down onMike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said ashe produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket andpulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place againsthis wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\"he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it anddisplaying it."

The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomachflipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, soplease don't start until I get to you. \" He began at Mike's table again,carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then Iwant you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet…\" He grabbedMike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Ohno. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs. \" He demonstrated,squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively,my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping redcard for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringingin my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so Ithought you should all know your blood type. \" He sounded proud ofhimself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent'spermission — I have slips at my desk. \"He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheekagainst the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as myclassmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out throughmy mouth. \"Bella, are you all right? \" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to myhead, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I wasafraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint? \"\"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when Ihad the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please? \" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered. \"Can you walk? \" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my armover his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of theclassroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of thecafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching,I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please? \" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I wasstill so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against thefreezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed tohelp a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella? \" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong — is she hurt? \" His voice was closer now, and he soundedupset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or,at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened,she didn't even stick her finger. \"\"Bella. \" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hearme? \"\"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away. \"He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"butshe wouldn't go any farther. \"\"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class. \"\"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it. \"Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open inshock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighedten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down! \" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walkingbefore I was finished talking. \"Hey! \" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walkwas not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting allmy weight with just his arms — it didn't seem to bother him. \"So you faint at the sight of blood? \" he asked. This seemed to entertainhim. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all mystrength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself. I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it wassuddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past thefront counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded frontoffice receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherlynurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into theroom and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brownvinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall asfar across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They'reblood typing in Biology. \"The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one. \"\fHe muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass. \"\"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot? \" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her. \" He said this with such assured authoritythat — even though she pursed her lips — the nurse didn't argue itfurther. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, andthen bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am — but about what in particular this time? \"\"Ditching is healthy. \" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tonemade it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thoughtNewton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods. \"\"Ha ha. \" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal everyminute. \"Honestly — I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that Imight have to avenge your murder. \"\"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad. \"\"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face — I could tell. \"\"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching. \" I was almost fine now,though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten somethingfor lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD. \" Such a normal response — itsurprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compressin her hand. \"Here you go, dear. \" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're lookingbetter,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears,no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door openedjust then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this. \"And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-lookingLee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew backagainst the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella. \"I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me — go. \"I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of theinfirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me. \" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick fromwatching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can — that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust… and salt. \"He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. \"What? \" I asked. \"It's nothing. \"Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look hegave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked backat me, his eyes glum. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class? \"\"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back. \"\"Yeah, I guess… So are you going this weekend? To the beach? \" While hespoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing againstthe cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in. \"\"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten. \" His eyes flickered to Edwardagain, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His bodylanguage made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door. \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightlypouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shouldersslumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing hisdisappointed face again… in Gym. \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that. \" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, buthe spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had lefta light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky foldingchairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Faintingspells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope? \"\"Yes? \" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think youcould excuse her from class? \" His voice was like melting honey. I couldimagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward? \" Ms. Cope fluttered. Whycouldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind. \"\"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again? \" With his back tothe receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk. \"I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, hissmile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mistthat had just begun to fall. It felt nice — the first time I'd enjoyedthe constant moisture falling out of the sky — as it washed my face cleanof the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sickto miss Gym. \"\"Anytime. \" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean? \" I was hoping he would, thoughit seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with therest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. Butjust hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd feltfor the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly? \" He was still looking ahead,expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach. \" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"Ireally don't think I was invited. \"I sighed. \"I just invited you. \"\"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't wanthim to snap. \" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than heshould. \"Mike-schmike. \" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I. \"I liked it more than I should. We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck."

I was confused. \"I'm going home. \"\"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'mgoing to let you drive in your condition? \" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck? \" I complained. \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school. \" He was towing me toward hiscar now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep fromfalling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go! \" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways acrossthe wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me — Istumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy! \" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home! \" I stood by the car,fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so myhair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella. \"I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching thetruck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn'tvery successful — I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up andthe music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing togive him the silent treatment — my face in full pout mode — but then Irecognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of myintentions. \"Clair de Lune? \" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy? \" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music aroundthe house — I only know my favorites. \"\"It's one of my favorites, too. \" He stared out through the rain, lost inthought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. Itwas impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rainblurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. Ibegan to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, soevenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gaveit away. \"What is your mother like? \" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised hiseyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am,and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a veryunpredictable cook. She's my best friend. \" I stopped. Talking about herwas making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella? \" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason Icouldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were atCharlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely seethe house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen. \"His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What? \" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get moremiddle-aged every year. \" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone hasto be the adult. \" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like ajunior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil? \"I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once,almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother… she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feeleven younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him. \" I shook my head. Theattraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve? \" he asked. \"Does it matter? \" I countered. \"I want her to be happy… and he is who shewants. \"\"That's very generous… I wonder,\" he mused. \"What? \"\"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter whoyour choice was? \" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's alittle bit different. \"\"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facialpiercings and extensive tattoos? \"\"That's one definition, I suppose. \"\"What's your definition? \"But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that Icould be scary? \" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smilelightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would goover better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm… I think you could be,if you wanted to. \"\"Are you frightened of me now? \" The smile vanished, and his heavenly facewas suddenly serious. \"No. \" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family? \" I asked to distracthim. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine. \"He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know? \"\"The Cullens adopted you? \" I verified. \"Yes. \"I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents? \"\"They died many years ago. \" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have beenmy parents for a long time now. \"\"And you love them. \" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way hespoke of them. \"Yes. \" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people. \"\f\"You're very lucky. \"\"I know I am. \"\"And your brother and sister? \"He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are goingto be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me. \"\"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go. \" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, soyou don't have to tell him about the Biology incident. \" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks. \" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach… good weather for sunbathing. \" He glanced out atthe sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow? \"\"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early. \"\"What are you going to do? \" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped thedisappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south ofRainier. \"I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun. \" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think Ifooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend? \" He turned to look mestraight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who justattract accidents like a magnet. So… try not to fall into the ocean orget run over or anything, all right? \" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him. \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. Islammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.

I would have thought, even over thepounding rain, I could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went topeek out the curtain — again — it was suddenly there. I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to mynon-expectations. Of course there were the fainting comments. Jessicaespecially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kepthis mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She\fdid have a lot of questions about lunch, though. \"So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday? \" Jessica asked in Trig. \"I don't know,\" I answered truthfully. \"He never really got to the point. \"\"You looked kind of mad,\" she fished. \"Did I? \" I kept my expression blank. \"You know, I've never seen him sit with anyone but his family before. That was weird. \"\"Weird,\" I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped her dark curlsimpatiently — I guessed she'd been hoping to hear something that wouldmake a good story for her to pass on. The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn't goingto be there, I still hoped. When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessicaand Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie,Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn't stopthe gloom that engulfed me as I realized I didn't know how long I wouldhave to wait before I saw him again. At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mikewas animated again, putting a great deal of trust in the local weathermanwho promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I believed it. Butit was warmer today — almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn't becompletely miserable. I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which Ididn't understand until we were all walking out of the room together. Iwas right behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond hair, andshe was evidently unaware of that. \"…don't know why Bella\" — she sneered my name — \"doesn't just sit withthe Cullens from now on. \"I heard her muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what an unpleasant,nasal voice she had, and I was surprised by the malice in it. I reallydidn't know her well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislikeme — or so I'd thought. \"She's my friend; she sits with us,\" Mikewhispered back loyally, but also a bit territorially. I paused to letJess and Angela pass me. I didn't want to hear any more. That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to LaPush in the morning. I think he felt guilty for leaving me home alone onthe weekends, but he'd spent too many years building his habits to breakthem now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and theirparents, and their great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed toapprove. I wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to Seattlewith Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him. \"Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? Ithink it's south of Mount Rainier,\" I asked casually. \"Yeah — why? \"I shrugged. \"Some kids were talking about camping there. \"\"It's not a very good place for camping. \" He sounded surprised. \"Too manybears. Most people go there during the hunting season. \"\"Oh,\" I murmured. \"Maybe I got the name wrong. \"I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyesto see a clear yellow light streaming through my window. I couldn'tbelieve it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough, there wasthe sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn'tseem to be as close as it should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in themiddle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if Ileft the blue would disappear again. The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seenthe store, but I'd never stopped there — not having much need for anysupplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of time. Inthe parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As Ipulled up next to their vehicles, I could see the group standing aroundin front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I hadclass with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess wasthere, flanked by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them,including one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That one gaveme a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something toLauren. Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully."

I was confused. \"I'm going home. \"\"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'mgoing to let you drive in your condition? \" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck? \" I complained. \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school. \" He was towing me toward hiscar now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep fromfalling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go! \" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways acrossthe wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me — Istumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy! \" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home! \" I stood by the car,fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so myhair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella. \"I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching thetruck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn'tvery successful — I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up andthe music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing togive him the silent treatment — my face in full pout mode — but then Irecognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of myintentions. \"Clair de Lune? \" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy? \" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music aroundthe house — I only know my favorites. \"\"It's one of my favorites, too. \" He stared out through the rain, lost inthought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. Itwas impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rainblurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. Ibegan to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, soevenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gaveit away. \"What is your mother like? \" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised hiseyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am,and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a veryunpredictable cook. She's my best friend. \" I stopped. Talking about herwas making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella? \" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason Icouldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were atCharlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely seethe house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen. \"His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What? \" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get moremiddle-aged every year. \" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone hasto be the adult. \" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like ajunior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil? \"I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once,almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother… she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feeleven younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him. \" I shook my head. Theattraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve? \" he asked. \"Does it matter? \" I countered. \"I want her to be happy… and he is who shewants. \"\"That's very generous… I wonder,\" he mused. \"What? \"\"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter whoyour choice was? \" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's alittle bit different. \"\"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facialpiercings and extensive tattoos? \"\"That's one definition, I suppose. \"\"What's your definition? \"But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that Icould be scary? \" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smilelightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would goover better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm… I think you could be,if you wanted to. \"\"Are you frightened of me now? \" The smile vanished, and his heavenly facewas suddenly serious. \"No. \" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family? \" I asked to distracthim. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine. \"He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know? \"\"The Cullens adopted you? \" I verified. \"Yes. \"I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents? \"\"They died many years ago. \" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have beenmy parents for a long time now. \"\"And you love them. \" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way hespoke of them. \"Yes. \" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people. \"\f\"You're very lucky. \"\"I know I am. \"\"And your brother and sister? \"He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are goingto be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me. \"\"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go. \" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, soyou don't have to tell him about the Biology incident. \" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks. \" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach… good weather for sunbathing. \" He glanced out atthe sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow? \"\"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early. \"\"What are you going to do? \" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped thedisappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south ofRainier. \"I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun. \" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think Ifooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend? \" He turned to look mestraight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who justattract accidents like a magnet. So… try not to fall into the ocean orget run over or anything, all right? \" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him. \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. Islammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.

But alsowishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied. \"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan. \"\"Sure. \"He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. \"You can have shotgun,\" he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't assimple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could seeJessica glowering at us now. The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people,and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in betweenMike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been moregraceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, densegreen forests edging the road most of the way and the wide QuillayuteRiver snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We'drolled the windows down — the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with ninepeople in it — and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible. I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summerswith Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar tome. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in thesunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands roseout of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to unevensummits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only athin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew intomillions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from adistance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta,sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn withhuge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piledtogether against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, justout of reach of the waves. There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicansfloated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment,but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring ofdriftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Ericand the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwoodfrom the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had ateepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders. \"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire? \" Mike asked me. I was sitting onone of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossipingexcitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting oneof the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter. \"No,\" I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee. \"You'll like this then — watch the colors. \" He lit another small branchand laid it alongside the first. The flames started to lick quickly upthe dry wood. \"It's blue,\" I said in surprise. \"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it? \" He lit one more piece, placed itwhere the fire hadn't yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully,Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention. I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to thenearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tidepools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of theonly things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On theother hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you'reseven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request — that I notfall into the ocean. Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike,and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the othergirls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. Iwaited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before Igot up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smilewhen he saw that I was coming. The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescentlaughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banteraround me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding rootsbelow and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I brokethrough the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shoreagain. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way tothe sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completelydrained were teeming with life. I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. Theothers were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously onthe edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of thelargest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the naturalaquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulatedceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about theedges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to therocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripeswove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I wascompletely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wonderedwhat Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be sayingif he were here with me. Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. Itried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally I fella few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of myjeans were stained green, but it could have been worse. When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind hadmultiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight blackhair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation\fcome to socialize. The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim ashare while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, Inoticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at mein interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwichesand an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be theoldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others withhim. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, andthe boy who noticed me was named Jacob. It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person tobe around — she didn't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinkingabout how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur attimes, with single images standing out more clearly than others. Andthen, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. Iknew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky,darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across thebeach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people startedto drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of thewaves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others weregathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike — with Jessicashadowing him — headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of thelocal kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the timethey all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, withLauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone hadthought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched aroundthe circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who hadacted as spokesperson. A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over totake her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and hadlong, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of hisneck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes weredark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had justa hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a verypretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by thefirst words out of his mouth. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you? \"It was like the first day of school all over again. \"Bella,\" I sighed. \"I'm Jacob Black. \" He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. \"Youbought my dad's truck. \"\"Oh,\" I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. \"You're Billy's son. Iprobably should remember you. \"\"No, I'm the youngest of the family — you would remember my oldersisters. \"\"Rachel and Rebecca,\" I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrownus together a lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. Wewere all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, I'd kickedup enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven. \"Are they here? \" I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if Iwould recognize them now. \"No. \" Jacob shook his head. \"Rachel got a scholarship to WashingtonState, and Rebecca married a Samoan surfer — she lives in Hawaii now. \"\"Married. Wow. \" I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a yearolder than I was. \"So how do you like the truck? \" he asked. \"I love it. It runs great. \"\"Yeah, but it's really slow,\" he laughed. \"I was so relived when Charliebought it. My dad wouldn't let me work on building another car when wehad a perfectly good vehicle right there. \"\"It's not that slow,\" I objected. \"Have you tried to go over sixty? \"\"No,\" I admitted. \"Good. Don't. \" He grinned. I couldn't help grinning back. \"It does great in a collision,\" I offeredin my truck's defense. \"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,\" he agreed withanother laugh. \"So you build cars? \" I asked, impressed. \"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where Icould get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit? \" headded jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. \"Sorry,\" I laughed, \"I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyesopen for you. \" As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I waslearning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who noticed. \"You know Bella, Jacob? \" Lauren asked — in what I imagined was aninsolent tone — from across the fire. \"We've sort of known each other since I was born,\" he laughed, smiling atme again. \"How nice. \" She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and herpale, fishy eyes narrowed. \"Bella,\" she called again, watching my face carefully, \"I was just sayingto Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them? \" Her expression of concern wasunconvincing. \"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family? \" the tall, older boy asked beforeI could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to aman than a boy, and his voice was very deep. \"Yes, do you know them? \" she asked condescendingly, turning halfwaytoward him. \"The Cullens don't come here,\" he said in a tone that closed the subject,ignoring her question. Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CDhe held. She was distracted. I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking awaytoward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't comehere, but his tone had implied something more — that they weren'tallowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression onme, and I tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. \"So is Forks driving you insane yet? \"\"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement. \" I grimaced. He grinnedunderstandingly. I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had asudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn't have any betterideas."

At least Mike was happy to see me. \"You came! \" he called, delighted. \"And I said it would be sunny today,didn't I? \"\"I told you I was coming,\" I reminded him. \"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha… unless you invited someone,\"Mike added. \"Nope,\" I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the lie. But alsowishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied. \"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan. \"\"Sure. \"He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. \"You can have shotgun,\" he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't assimple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could seeJessica glowering at us now. The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people,and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in betweenMike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been moregraceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, densegreen forests edging the road most of the way and the wide QuillayuteRiver snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We'drolled the windows down — the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with ninepeople in it — and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible. I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summerswith Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar tome. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in thesunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands roseout of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to unevensummits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only athin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew intomillions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from adistance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta,sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold.

                "text": "I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, sothat he wouldn't see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting. \"Do you want to walk down the beach with me? \" I asked, trying to imitatethat way Edward had of looking up from underneath his eyelashes. Itcouldn't have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob jumped upwillingly enough. As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwoodseawall, the clouds finally closed ranks across the sky, causing the seato darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep into thepockets of my jacket. \"So you're, what, sixteen? \" I asked, trying not to look like an idiot asI fluttered my eyelids the way I'd seen girls do on TV. \"I just turned fifteen,\" he confessed, flattered. \"Really? \" My face was full of false surprise. \"I would have thought youwere older. \"\"I'm tall for my age,\" he explained. \"Do you come up to Forks much? \" I asked archly, as if I was hoping for ayes. I sounded idiotic to myself. I was afraid he would turn on me withdisgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed flattered. \"Not too much,\" he admitted with a frown. \"But when I get my car finishedI can go up as much as I want — after I get my license,\" he amended. \"Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He seemed a little old tobe hanging out with us. \" I purposefully lumped myself in with theyoungsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob. \"That's Sam — he's nineteen,\" he informed me. \"What was that he was saying about the doctor's family? \" I askedinnocently. \"The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto the reservation. \" Helooked away, out toward James Island, as he confirmed what I'd thoughtI'd heard in Sam's voice. \"Why not? \"He glanced back at me, biting his lip. \"Oops. I'm not supposed to sayanything about that. \"\"Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious. \" I tried to make my smilealluring, wondering if I was laying it on too thick. He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he lifted one eyebrow andhis voice was even huskier than before. \"Do you like scary stories? \" he asked ominously. \"I love them,\" I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him. Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking outlike the attenuated legs of a huge, pale spider. He perched lightly onone of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of the tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of hisbroad lips. I could see he was going to try to make this good. I focusedon keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes. \"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from — theQuileutes, I mean? \" he began. \"Not really,\" I admitted. \"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back tothe Flood — supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to thetops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and theark. \" He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. \"Another legend claims that we descended from wolves — and that thewolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them. \"Then there are the stories about the cold ones. \" His voice dropped alittle lower. \"The cold ones? \" I asked, not faking my intrigue now. \"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, andsome much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knewsome of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off ourland. \" He rolled his eyes. \"Your great-grandfather? \" I encouraged. \"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are thenatural enemies of the wolf—well, not the wolf, really, but the wolvesthat turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves. \"\"Werewolves have enemies? \"\"Only one. \"I stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration. \"So you see,\" Jacob continued, \"the cold ones are traditionally ourenemies. But this pack that came to our territory during mygreat-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way othersof their kind did — they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with them. If they would promise tostay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces. \" He winkedat me. \"If they weren't dangerous, then why… ? \" I tried to understand,struggling not to let him see how seriously I was considering his ghoststory. \"There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even ifthey're civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might gettoo hungry to resist. \" He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace intohis tone. \"What do you mean, 'civilized'? \"\"They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They supposedly were somehowable to prey on animals instead. \"I tried to keep my voice casual. \"So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather met? \"\"No. \" He paused dramatically. \"They are the same ones. \"He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by hisstory. He smiled, pleased, and continued. \"There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the restare the same. In my great-grandfather's time they already knew of theleader, Carlisle. He'd been here and gone before your people had evenarrived. \" He was fighting a smile. \"And what are they? \" I finally asked. \"What are the cold ones? \"He smiled darkly. \"Blood drinkers,\" he replied in a chilling voice. \"Your people call themvampires. \"I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face\fwas exposing. \"You have goose bumps,\" he laughed delightedly. \"You're a good storyteller,\" I complimented him, still staring into thewaves. \"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want usto talk about it to anyone. \"I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. \"Don't worry,I won't give you away. \"\"I guess I just violated the treaty,\" he laughed. \"I'll take it to the grave,\" I promised, and then I shivered. \"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad atmy dad when he heard that some of us weren't going to the hospital sinceDr. Cullen started working there. \"\"I won't, of course not. \"\"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what? \" heasked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn't lookedaway from the ocean. I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could. \"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I stillhave goose bumps, see? \" I held up my arm. \"Cool. \" He smiled. And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each otherwarned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the sametime to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us. \"There you are, Bella,\" Mike called in relief, waving his arm over hishead. \"Is that your boyfriend? \" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge inMike's voice. I was surprised it was so obvious. \"No, definitely not,\" I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob,and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefullyturning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting. \"So when I get my license…\" he began. \"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime. \" I feltguilty as I said this, knowing that I'd used him. But I really did likeJacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could seehis eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth. \"Where have you been? \" he asked, though the answer was right in front ofhim. \"Jacob was just telling me some local stories,\" I volunteered. \"It wasreally interesting. \"I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. \"Well,\" Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watchedour camaraderie. \"We're packing up — it looks like it's going to rainsoon. \"We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. \"Okay. \" I jumped up. \"I'm coming. \"\f\"It was nice to see you again,\" Jacob said, and I could tell he wastaunting Mike just a bit. \"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come,too,\" I promised. His grin stretched across his face. \"That would be cool. \"\"And thanks,\" I added earnestly. I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parkinglot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stoneswhere they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were alreadyloading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela andTyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Laurentwisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I couldsimply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hardnot to think. Chapter 7 Nightmare\n    I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't wantanything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excitedabout, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so hewasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I foundmy old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I pickedup a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of hisfavorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for mytastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on theheadphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. Iclosed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow overthe top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand thelyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'dlistened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least. I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once Igot past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again. And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think —which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD againand again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally,I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of myconsciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of theforest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewherenearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tuggingon my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong? \" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked withall his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run! \" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella! \" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomyheart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why? \" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now tofind the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to thedim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror. \"Jacob! \" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brownwolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward theshore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growlsissuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run! \" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. Iwas watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, hiseyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come tohim. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth weresharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire,fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No! \" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off thebedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor."

                "text": "My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, withmy shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It wasfive-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled backover and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried tostay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortableridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped therubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. Ipulled the pillow back over my eyes. It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly theimages I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have toface them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long aspossible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Eventaking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do inthe bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn'ttell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went tolook out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed — somethingI never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk andswitched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my freeservice substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to goget myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed thebowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as Iclimbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off thefloor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled outthe headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned thesame CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise. With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen wascovered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closingall the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite searchengine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up,there was a lot to sift through — everything from movies and TV shows torole-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site — Vampires A—Z. I waited impatiently for itto load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished — simple white background with blacktext, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page:\n　　Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figureso terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with suchfearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nordemon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysteriousand terrible qualities of both. — Rev. Montague SummersIf there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of thevampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-knownpeople, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof ismost complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? — RousseauThe rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the differentmyths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, theDanag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro onthe islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked withhumans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cuther finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much thatit drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything thatsounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire mythscentered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; theyalso seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortalityrates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Manyof the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improperburials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, andonly a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who wereeven preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, apowerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinnedhuman, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it couldmassacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and oneother, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence. Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side ofgoodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds thatclaimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories ormy own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd readand carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, paleskin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers,enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very fewmyths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small numberof scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading —vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to acinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waitingto shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelmingembarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room,researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of theblame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks — and the entiresodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go thatdidn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclearwhere I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoatwithout checking the weather and stomped out the door. It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started easton foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroachingforest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and theroad to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the dampearth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or Iwouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction washopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trailwound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I couldtell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews andthe maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and allI knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser windowin earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't besure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. Asthat started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down fromthe canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning torain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in theleaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recentlyfallen tree — I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted inmoss — rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating asheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped overthe ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the dampseat and my clothes wherever they touched, and leaned my hooded head backagainst the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but whereelse was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like thescene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that therewas no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it mustbe raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I wasseated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away,and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities thatembarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousandsof years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different landsseemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cutbedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer,but I did so unwillingly. First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said aboutthe Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was sillyand morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I askedmyself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at thismoment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: theimpossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold\fand back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more —small things that registered slowly — how they never seemed to eat, thedisturbing grace with which they moved. And the way besometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit thestyle of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-centuryclassroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn'tsaid no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed toknow what everyone around him was thinking… except me. He had told me hewas the villain, dangerous…Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rationaljustification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whetherit be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen wasnot… human. He was something more. So then — maybe. That would have to be my answer for now. And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if itwas true? If Edward was a vampire — I could hardly make myself think the words —then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. Icouldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed. Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: tobe smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to goback to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was animpenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we wereforced together. To tell him to leave me alone — and mean it this time. I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered thatalternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the nextoption. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something… sinister,he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent inTyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued withmyself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex tosave lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around inanswerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The darkEdward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of theword Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamedout in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf thatbrought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed —even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was achoice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew — if I knew —I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought ofhim, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of hispersonality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Evenif… but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Notwhile the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered likefootsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quicklyfrom my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would havedisappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the drippinggreen maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face,becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I hadcome."

                "text": "I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following thepath farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get toopanicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbedbranches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I wasfree, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoningme, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressedfor the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn'ttake too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper onMacbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draftcontentedly, more serene than I'd felt since… well, since Thursdayafternoon, if I was being honest. That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painfulpart for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, Isimply followed through — usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come toForks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives. This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy. And so the day was quiet, productive — I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick upa book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chillsthat flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were nodifferent than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with JacobBlack. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid — I knew Ishould be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early,and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second timesince arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. Iskipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud inthe sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs thatcouldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window — surprisedwhen it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in whoknows how many years — and sucked in the relatively dry air. It wasnearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins. Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked upon my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charliesmiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quicklyinto an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in thosedays had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair — the samecolor, if not the same texture, as mine — had dwindled, slowly revealingmore and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled Icould see a little of the man who had run away with Renée when she wasjust two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in thesunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye,and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my wayout the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leaveit home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into thebrightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truckalmost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; Ihadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked andheaded toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of thecafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket,glad to have a use for it. My homework was done — the product of a slowsocial life — but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I hadright. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through recheckingthe first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on thered-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of myhomework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairsof dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with theeraser. \"Bella! \" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'dbeen sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even inshorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was comingtoward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving. \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morninglike this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in thelight, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to seeme, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before — your hair has red in it,\" he commented,catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the lightbreeze. \"Only in the sun. \"I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it? \"\"My kind of day,\" I agreed. \"What did you do yesterday? \" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay. \" I didn't add that I was finished with it —no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah — that's dueThursday, right? \"\"Um, Wednesday, I think. \"\"Wednesday? \" He frowned. \"That's not good… What are you writing yours on? \"\"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters ismisogynistic. \"He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"Iwas going to ask if you wanted to go out. \"\"Oh. \" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasantconversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something… and I could work on it later. \"He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike…\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be thebest idea. \"His face fell. \"Why? \" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickeredto Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think… and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I willcheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurtJessica's feelings. \"He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all. \"Jessica? \"\"Really, Mike, are you blind? \"\"Oh,\" he exhaled — clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make myescape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again. \" I gathered my books upand stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was\fdistracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading himin the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She,Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dressshopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though Ididn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of townwith some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what Icould be doing tonight… But that was definitely the wrong path to let mymind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But thatwasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not evenclose. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing asif without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late,and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy ofanticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager tosee not just him but all the Cullens — to compare them with the newsuspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of thecafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine andsettle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? Andthen a different feeling jolted through me — would Edward be waiting tosit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver ofpanic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindlinghope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find himalone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled — Spanish had made uslate — but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolationhit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listenanymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided theempty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticedthat Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face litup in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which Ianswered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She,too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping atanything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I enteredBiology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture onthe rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But atleast it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on thecourt. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another dayoff tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with aracket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before Iwent out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked inthe door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I triedto be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner — I really was relievedthat he finally seemed to be catching on — but my enthusiasm soundedfalse in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrownight. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fishmarinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the nightbefore, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour onhomework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail,reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as theyprogressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response. Mom,Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had towrite a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to gooutside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you,Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a smallcollection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volumebeing a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one andheaded to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linencupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half andlaid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn thatwould always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay onmy stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the differentnovels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the mostthoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense andSensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Senseand Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero ofthe story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to MansfieldPark, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just tooclose. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenthcentury? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back. I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. Iwould think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around myface, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, lettingit fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat thattouched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, myneck, soaked through my light shirt…The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiserturning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizingthe light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I lookedaround, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone. \"Charlie? \" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of thehouse."

                "text": "I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. Iran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinnerwould be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out ofhis boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet — I fell asleep outside. \" I stifled ayawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on thegame, anyway. \"I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn'tanything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so heturned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemedhappy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despitemy depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to lookat dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted\fme to help them choose… do you mind if I go with them? \"\"Jessica Stanley? \" he asked. \"And Angela Weber. \" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right? \"\"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses — you know, giving themconstructive criticism. \" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay. \" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with thegirlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though. \"\"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okayfor dinner, right? \"\"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" hereminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly,\"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top. \"It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that Igrimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blueV-neck blouse — something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix. I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make itto class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for aspace, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly notthere. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arrivingbreathless, but subdued, before the final bell. It was the same as yesterday — I just couldn't keep little sprouts ofhope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as Isearched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all themore attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I wasanxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder,hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. Ivowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruinAngela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do alittle clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might beshopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in theearlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least tellingme. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that Icould ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when Iwas inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated gettingout of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining againwhere to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to apurse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela'shouse next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increasedexponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits. Chapter 8 Port Angeles\n    Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a girls' night out, and the estrogenrush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessicajabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mikehad gone very well, and she was hoping that by Saturday night they would\fhave progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not reallyinterested in Eric. Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was,but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to spareher. Angela threw a grateful glance my way. Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished andquaint than Forks. But Jessica and Angela knew it well, so they didn'tplan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess drovestraight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streetsin from the bay area's visitor-friendly face. The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what thatmeant. Both Jessica and Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelievingwhen I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix. \"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something? \" Jess asked dubiouslyas we walked through the front doors of the store. \"Really,\" I tried to convince her, not wanting to confess my dancingproblems. \"I've never had a boyfriend or anything close. I didn't go outmuch. \"\"Why not? \" Jessica demanded. \"No one asked me,\" I answered honestly. She looked skeptical. \"People ask you out here,\" she reminded me, \"andyou tell them no. \" We were in the juniors' section now, scanning theracks for dress-up clothes. \"Well, except for Tyler,\" Angela amended quietly. \"Excuse me? \" I gasped. \"What did you say? \"\"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom,\" Jessica informed me withsuspicious eyes. \"He said what? \" I sounded like I was choking. \"I told you it wasn't true,\" Angela murmured to Jessica. I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and now we had work to do. \"That's why Lauren doesn't like you,\" Jessica giggled while we pawedthrough the clothes. I ground my teeth. \"Do you think that if I ran him over with my truck hewould stop feeling guilty about the accident? That he might give up onmaking amends and call it even? \"\"Maybe,\" Jess snickered. '\"If that's why he's doing this. \"The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things totry on. I sat on a low chair just inside the dressing room, by thethree-way mirror, trying to control my fuming. Jess was torn between two — one a long, strapless, basic black number,the other a knee-length electric blue with spaghetti straps. I encouragedher to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose a palepink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honeytints in her light brown hair. I complimented them both generously andhelped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole process wasmuch shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Renée at home. I guess there was something to be said for limited choices. We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on Imerely watched and critiqued, not in the mood to shop for myself, thoughI did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the wakeof my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in. \"Angela? \" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a pair of pinkstrappy heels — she was overjoyed to have a date tall enough that shecould wear high heels at all. Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone. \"Yes? \" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a better view ofthe shoe. I chickened out. \"I like those. \"\"I think I'll get them — though they'll never match anything but the onedress,\" she mused. \"Oh, go ahead — they're on sale,\" I encouraged. She smiled, putting thelid back on a box that contained more practical-looking off-white shoes. I tried again. \"Um, Angela…\" She looked up curiously. \"Is it normal for the… Cullens\" — I kept my eyes on the shoes — \"to beout of school a lot? \" I failed miserably in my attempt to soundnonchalant. \"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time — eventhe doctor. They're all real outdoorsy,\" she told me quietly, examiningher shoes, too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the hundreds thatJessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela. \"Oh. \" I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us therhinestone jewelry she'd found to match her silver shoes. We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on theboardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and thenwalk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant inan hour — I wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing tocome with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun — they didn't know howpreoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something Ipreferred to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, andI headed in the direction Jess pointed out. I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was lookingfor. The windows were full of crystals, dream-catchers, and books aboutspiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I could seea fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back,clad in a dress right out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behindthe counter. I decided that was one conversation I could skip. There hadto be a normal bookstore in town. I meandered through the streets, which were filling up withend-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was headed toward downtown. Iwasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I waswrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, andwhat Angela had said… and more than anything trying to beat down my hopesfor Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when Ilooked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and itall came crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought tomyself. I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shopsthat looked promising. But when I got to them, they were just a repairshop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking for Jessand Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before Imet back up with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of timesand took some deep breaths before I continued around the corner. I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going thewrong direction. The little foot traffic I had seen was going north, andit looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided toturn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks andtry my luck on a different street on my way back to the boardwalk. A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressedtoo casually to be heading home from the office, but they were too grimyto be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they weren't too manyyears older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves,laughing raucously and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far tothe inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking swiftly,looking past them to the corner. \"Hey, there! \" one of them called as they passed, and he had to be talkingto me since no one else was around. I glanced up automatically. Two ofthem had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a heavyset,dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who hadspoken. He was wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-offjeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me. \"Hello,\" I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away andwalked faster toward the corner. I could hear them laughing at fullvolume behind me. \"Hey, wait! \" one of them called after me again, but I kept my head downand rounded the corner with a sigh of relief. I could still hear themchortling behind me. I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of severalsomber-colored warehouses, each with large bay doors for unloadingtrucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had nosidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting somekind of engine parts storage yard. I'd wandered far past the part of PortAngeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, Irealized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon,creating an early sunset. The eastern sky was still clear, but graying,shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in thecar, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. Asingle van passed me, and then the road was empty. The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder toglare at the offending cloud, I realized with a shock that two men werewalking quietly twenty feet behind me."

                "text": "They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neitherwas the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once,quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather mademe shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slungacross my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't getsnatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was — still in my dufflebag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, justa twenty and some ones, and I thought about \"accidentally\" dropping mybag and walking away. But a small, frightened voice in the back of mymind warned me that they might be something worse than thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quietwhen compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and itdidn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. Icontinued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running,focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from menow. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A bluecar turned onto the street from the south and drove quickly past me. Ithought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsurethat I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only ablind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned inanticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrowdrive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, wherethere was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me,deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and Iknew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and gosprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitelyfarther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they weremaybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staringat me. It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pacesteady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind withevery step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I sawtwo cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and Iexhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off thisdeserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh. And skidded to a stop. The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two intersections down, streetlamps, cars,and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because loungingagainst the western building, midway down the street, were the other twomen from the group, both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead onthe sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being followed. I was being herded. I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turnedthen and darted to the other side of the road. I had a sinking feelingthat it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now. \"There you are! \" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired manshattered the intense quiet and made me jump. In the gathering darkness,it seemed like he was looking past me. \"Yeah,\" a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as Itried to hurry down the street. \"We just took a little detour. \"My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself andthe lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud scream, and I sucked inair, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how muchvolume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over myhead, gripping the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use itas weapon as need demanded. The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop,and walked slowly into the street. \"Stay away from me,\" I warned in a voice that was supposed to soundstrong and fearless. But I was right about the dry throat — no volume. \"Don't be like that, sugar,\" he called, and the raucous laughter startedagain behind me. I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic whatlittle self-defense I knew. Heel of the hand thrust upward, hopefullybreaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eyesocket — try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee tothe groin, of course. That same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke upthen, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance against one ofthem, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terrorcould incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent scream. Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting thestocky one, forcing him to jump back toward the sidewalk. I dove into theroad — this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver carunexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passengerdoor open just a few feet from me. \"Get in,\" a furious voice commanded. It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing howsuddenly the feeling of security washed over me — even before I was offthe street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into the seat,slamming the door shut behind me. It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of thedoor, and I could barely see his face in the glow from the dashboard. Thetires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly,\fswerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of themdiving for the sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. \"Put on your seat belt,\" he commanded, and I realized I was clutching theseat with both hands. I quickly obeyed; the snap as the belt connectedwas loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, blowingthrough several stop signs without a pause. But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned aboutwhere we were going. I stared at his face in profound relief, relief thatwent beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in thelimited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until itoccurred to me that his expression was murderously angry. \"Are you okay? \" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. \"No,\" he said curtly, and his tone was livid. I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes staredstraight ahead, until the car came to a sudden stop. I glanced around,but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of darktrees crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore. \"Bella? \" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. \"Yes? \" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. \"Are you all right? \" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plainon his face. \"Yes,\" I croaked softly. \"Distract me, please,\" he ordered. \"I'm sorry, what? \"He exhaled sharply. \"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,\" heclarified, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose with histhumb and forefinger. \"Um. \" I wracked my brain for something trivial. \"I'm going to run overTyler Crowley tomorrow before school? \"He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner of his mouthtwitched. \"Why? \"\"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom — either he's insaneor he's still trying to make up for almost killing me last… well, youremember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this. SoI figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keeptrying to make amends. I don't need enemies and maybe Lauren would backoff if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If hedoesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom…\" I babbled on. \"I heard about that. \" He sounded a bit more composed. \"You did? \" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. \"If he'sparalyzed from the neck down, he can't go to the prom, either,\" Imuttered, refining my plan. Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes. \"Better? \"\"Not really. \"I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against theseat, staring at the ceiling of the car. His face was rigid. \"What's wrong? \" My voice came out in a whisper. \"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella. \" He was whispering,too, and as he stared out the window, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"Butit wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down those…\" Hedidn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment tocontrol his anger again. \"At least,\" he continued, \"that's what I'mtrying to convince myself. \"\"Oh. \" The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a betterresponse. We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It waspast six-thirty. \"Jessica and Angela will be worried,\" I murmured. \"I was supposed to meetthem. \"He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly andspeeding back toward town. We were under the streetlights in no time atall, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars slowlycruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space Iwould have thought much too small for the Volvo, but he slid ineffortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of LaBella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously awayfrom us. \"How did you know where… ? \" I began, but then I just shook my head. Iheard the door open and turned to see him getting out. \"What are you doing? \" I asked. \"I'm taking you to dinner. \" He smiled slightly, but his eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and slammed the door. I fumbled with my seatbelt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was waiting forme on the sidewalk. He spoke before I could. \"Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have totrack them down, too. I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran intoyour other friends again. \"I shivered at the threat in his voice. \"Jess! Angela! \" I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushedback to me, the pronounced relief on both their faces simultaneouslychanging to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. Theyhesitated a few feet from us. \"Where have you been? \" Jessica's voice was suspicious. \"I got lost,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"And then I ran into Edward. \" Igestured toward him. \"Would it be all right if I joined you? \" he asked in his silken,irresistible voice.

                "text": "They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neitherwas the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once,quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather mademe shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slungacross my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't getsnatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was — still in my dufflebag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, justa twenty and some ones, and I thought about \"accidentally\" dropping mybag and walking away. But a small, frightened voice in the back of mymind warned me that they might be something worse than thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quietwhen compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and itdidn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. Icontinued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running,focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from menow. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A bluecar turned onto the street from the south and drove quickly past me. Ithought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsurethat I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only ablind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned inanticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrowdrive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, wherethere was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me,deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and Iknew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and gosprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitelyfarther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they weremaybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staringat me. It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pacesteady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind withevery step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I sawtwo cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and Iexhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off thisdeserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh. And skidded to a stop. The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two intersections down, streetlamps, cars,and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because loungingagainst the western building, midway down the street, were the other twomen from the group, both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead onthe sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being followed. I was being herded. I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turnedthen and darted to the other side of the road. I had a sinking feelingthat it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now. \"There you are! \" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired manshattered the intense quiet and made me jump. In the gathering darkness,it seemed like he was looking past me. \"Yeah,\" a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as Itried to hurry down the street. \"We just took a little detour. \"My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself andthe lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud scream, and I sucked inair, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how muchvolume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over myhead, gripping the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use itas weapon as need demanded. The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop,and walked slowly into the street. \"Stay away from me,\" I warned in a voice that was supposed to soundstrong and fearless. But I was right about the dry throat — no volume. \"Don't be like that, sugar,\" he called, and the raucous laughter startedagain behind me. I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic whatlittle self-defense I knew. Heel of the hand thrust upward, hopefullybreaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eyesocket — try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee tothe groin, of course. That same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke upthen, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance against one ofthem, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terrorcould incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent scream. Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting thestocky one, forcing him to jump back toward the sidewalk. I dove into theroad — this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver carunexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passengerdoor open just a few feet from me. \"Get in,\" a furious voice commanded. It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing howsuddenly the feeling of security washed over me — even before I was offthe street — as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into the seat,slamming the door shut behind me. It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of thedoor, and I could barely see his face in the glow from the dashboard. Thetires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly,\fswerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of themdiving for the sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. \"Put on your seat belt,\" he commanded, and I realized I was clutching theseat with both hands. I quickly obeyed; the snap as the belt connectedwas loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, blowingthrough several stop signs without a pause. But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned aboutwhere we were going. I stared at his face in profound relief, relief thatwent beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in thelimited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until itoccurred to me that his expression was murderously angry. \"Are you okay? \" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. \"No,\" he said curtly, and his tone was livid. I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes staredstraight ahead, until the car came to a sudden stop. I glanced around,but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of darktrees crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore. \"Bella? \" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. \"Yes? \" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. \"Are you all right? \" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plainon his face. \"Yes,\" I croaked softly. \"Distract me, please,\" he ordered. \"I'm sorry, what? \"He exhaled sharply. \"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,\" heclarified, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose with histhumb and forefinger. \"Um. \" I wracked my brain for something trivial. \"I'm going to run overTyler Crowley tomorrow before school? \"He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner of his mouthtwitched. \"Why? \"\"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom — either he's insaneor he's still trying to make up for almost killing me last… well, youremember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this. SoI figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keeptrying to make amends. I don't need enemies and maybe Lauren would backoff if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If hedoesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom…\" I babbled on. \"I heard about that. \" He sounded a bit more composed. \"You did? \" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. \"If he'sparalyzed from the neck down, he can't go to the prom, either,\" Imuttered, refining my plan. Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes. \"Better? \"\"Not really. \"I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against theseat, staring at the ceiling of the car. His face was rigid. \"What's wrong? \" My voice came out in a whisper. \"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella. \" He was whispering,too, and as he stared out the window, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"Butit wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down those…\" Hedidn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment tocontrol his anger again. \"At least,\" he continued, \"that's what I'mtrying to convince myself. \"\"Oh. \" The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a betterresponse. We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It waspast six-thirty. \"Jessica and Angela will be worried,\" I murmured. \"I was supposed to meetthem. \"He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly andspeeding back toward town. We were under the streetlights in no time atall, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars slowlycruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space Iwould have thought much too small for the Volvo, but he slid ineffortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of LaBella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously awayfrom us. \"How did you know where… ? \" I began, but then I just shook my head. Iheard the door open and turned to see him getting out. \"What are you doing? \" I asked. \"I'm taking you to dinner. \" He smiled slightly, but his eyes were hard. He stepped out of the car and slammed the door. I fumbled with my seatbelt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was waiting forme on the sidewalk. He spoke before I could. \"Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have totrack them down, too. I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran intoyour other friends again. \"I shivered at the threat in his voice. \"Jess! Angela! \" I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushedback to me, the pronounced relief on both their faces simultaneouslychanging to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. Theyhesitated a few feet from us. \"Where have you been? \" Jessica's voice was suspicious. \"I got lost,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"And then I ran into Edward. \" Igestured toward him. \"Would it be all right if I joined you? \" he asked in his silken,irresistible voice. I could see from their staggered expressions that hehad never unleashed his talents on them before. \"Er… sure,\" Jessica breathed. \"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting — sorry,\"Angela confessed. \"That's fine — I'm not hungry. \" I shrugged. \"I think you should eat something. \" Edward's voice was low, but full ofauthority.

She stood with her back to me as she placed them on thetable. \"Are you ready to order? \" she asked Edward. \"Bella? \" he asked. She turned unwillingly toward me. I picked the first thing I saw on the menu. \"Um… I'll have the mushroomravioli. \"\"And you? \" She turned back to him with a smile. \"Nothing for me,\" he said. Of course not. \"Let me know if you change your mind. \" The coy smile was still in place,but he wasn't looking at her, and she left dissatisfied. \"Drink,\" he ordered. I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more deeply, surprised byhow thirsty I was. I realized I had finished the whole thing when hepushed his glass toward me. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, still thirsty. The cold from the icy soda wasradiating through my chest, and I shivered. \"Are you cold? \"\"It's just the Coke,\" I explained, shivering again. \"Don't you have a jacket? \" His voice was disapproving. \"Yes. \" I looked at the empty bench next to me. \"Oh — I left it inJessica's car,\" I realized. Edward was shrugging out of his jacket. I suddenly realized that I hadnever once noticed what he was wearing — not just tonight, but ever. Ijust couldn't seem to look away from his face. I made myself look now,focusing. He was removing a light beige leather jacket now; underneath he\fwore an ivory turtleneck sweater. It fit him snugly, emphasizing howmuscular his chest was. He handed me the jacket, interrupting my ogling. \"Thanks,\" I said again, sliding my arms into his jacket. It was cold —the way my jacket felt when I first picked it up in the morning, hangingin the drafty hallway. I shivered again. It smelled amazing. I inhaled,trying to identify the delicious scent. It didn't smell like cologne. Thesleeves were much too long; I shoved them back so I could free my hands. \"That color blue looks lovely with your skin,\" he said, watching me. Iwas surprised; I looked down, flushing, of course. He pushed the bread basket toward me. \"Really, I'm not going into shock,\" I protested. \"You should be — a normal person would be. You don't even look shaken. \"He seemed unsettled. He stared into my eyes, and I saw how light his eyeswere, lighter than I'd ever seen them, golden butterscotch. \"I feel very safe with you,\" I confessed, mesmerized into telling thetruth again. That displeased him; his alabaster brow furrowed. He shook his head,frowning. \"This is more complicated than I'd planned,\" he murmured to himself. I picked up a breadstick and began nibbling on the end, measuring hisexpression. I wondered when it would be okay to start questioning him. \"Usually you're in a better mood when your eyes are so light,\" Icommented, trying to distract him from whatever thought had left himfrowning and somber. He stared at me, stunned. \"What? \"\"You're always crabbier when your eyes are black — I expect it then,\" Iwent on. \"I have a theory about that. \"His eyes narrowed. \"More theories? \"\"Mm-hm. \" I chewed on a small bite of the bread, trying to lookindifferent. \"I hope you were more creative this time… or are you still stealing fromcomic books? \" His faint smile was mocking; his eyes were still tight. \"Well, no, I didn't get it from a comic book, but I didn't come up withit on my own, either,\" I confessed. \"And? \" he prompted. But then the waitress strode around the partition with my food. Irealized we'd been unconsciously leaning toward each other across thetable, because we both straightened up as she approached. She set thedish in front of me — it looked pretty good — and turned quickly toEdward. \"Did you change your mind? \" she asked. \"Isn't there anything I can getyou? \" I may have been imagining the double meaning in her words. \"No, thank you, but some more soda would be nice. \" He gestured with along white hand to the empty cups in front of me. \"Sure. \" She removed the empty glasses and walked away. \"You were saying? \" he asked. \"I'll tell you about it in the car. If…\" I paused. \"There are conditions? \" He raised one eyebrow, his voice ominous. \"I do have a few questions, of course. \"\"Of course. \"The waitress was back with two more Cokes. She sat them down without aword this time, and left again. I took a sip. \"Well, go ahead,\" he pushed, his voice still hard. I started with the most undemanding. Or so I thought. \"Why are you inPort Angeles? \"He looked down, folding his large hands together slowly on the table. Hiseyes flickered up at me from under his lashes, the hint of a smirk on hisface. \"Next. \"\"But that's the easiest one,\" I objected. \"Next,\" he repeated. I looked down, frustrated. I unrolled my silverware, picked up my fork,and carefully speared a ravioli. I put it in my mouth slowly, stilllooking down, chewing while I thought. The mushrooms were good. Iswallowed and took another sip of Coke before I looked up. \"Okay, then. \" I glared at him, and continued slowly. \"Let's say,hypothetically of course, that… someone… could know what people arethinking, read minds, you know — with a few exceptions. \"\"Just one exception,\" he corrected, \"hypothetically. \"\"All right, with one exception, then. \" I was thrilled that he was playingalong, but I tried to seem casual. \"How does that work? What are the limitations? How would… that someone…find someone else at exactly the right time? How would he know she was introuble? \" I wondered if my convoluted questions even made sense. \"Hypothetically? \" he asked. \"Sure. \"\"Well, if… that someone…\"\"Let's call him 'Joe,'\" I suggested. He smiled wryly. \"Joe, then. If Joe had been paying attention, the timingwouldn't have needed to be quite so exact. \" He shook his head, rollinghis eyes. \"Only you could get into trouble in a town this small. Youwould have devastated their crime rate statistics for a decade, you know. \"\"We were speaking of a hypothetical case,\" I reminded him frostily. He laughed at me, his eyes warm. \"Yes, we were,\" he agreed. \"Shall we call you 'Jane'? \"\"How did you know? \" I asked, unable to curb my intensity. I realized Iwas leaning toward him again. He seemed to be wavering, torn by some internal dilemma. His eyes lockedwith mine, and I guessed he was making the decision right then whether ornot to simply tell me the truth. \"You can trust me, you know,\" I murmured. I reached forward, without\fthinking, to touch his folded hands, but he slid them away minutely, andI pulled my hand back. \"I don't know if I have a choice anymore. \" His voice was almost awhisper. \"I was wrong — you're much more observant than I gave you creditfor. \"\"I thought you were always right. \"\"I used to be. \" He shook his head again. \"I was wrong about you on oneother thing, as well. You're not a magnet for accidents — that's not abroad enough classification. You are a magnet for trouble. If there isanything dangerous within a ten-mile radius, it will invariably find you. \"\"And you put yourself into that category? \" I guessed. His face turned cold, expressionless. \"Unequivocally. \"I stretched my hand across the table again — ignoring him when he pulledback slightly once more — to touch the back of his hand shyly with myfingertips. His skin was cold and hard, like a stone. \"Thank you. \" My voice was fervent with gratitude. \"That's twice now. \"His face softened. \"Let's not try for three, agreed? \"I scowled, but nodded. He moved his hand out from under mine, placingboth of his under the table. But he leaned toward me. \"I followed you to Port Angeles,\" he admitted, speaking in a rush. \"I'venever tried to keep a specific person alive before, and it's much moretroublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just becauseit's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so manycatastrophes. \" He paused. I wondered if it should bother me that he wasfollowing me; instead I felt a strange surge of pleasure. He stared,maybe wondering why my lips were curving into an involuntary smile. \"Did you ever think that maybe my number was up the first time, with thevan, and that you've been interfering with fate? \" I speculated,distracting myself. \"That wasn't the first time,\" he said, and his voice was hard to hear. Istared at him in amazement, but he was looking down. \"Your number was upthe first time I met you. \"I felt a spasm of fear at his words, and the abrupt memory of his violentblack glare that first day… but the overwhelming sense of safety I feltin his presence stifled it. By the time he looked up to read my eyes,there was no trace of fear in them. \"You remember? \" he asked, his angel's face grave. \"Yes. \" I was calm. \"And yet here you sit. \" There was a trace of disbelief in his voice; heraised one eyebrow. \"Yes, here I sit… because of you. \" I paused. \"Because somehow you knewhow to find me today… ? \" I prompted. He pressed his lips together, staring at me through narrowed eyes,deciding again. His eyes flashed down to my full plate, and then back tome. \"You eat, I'll talk,\" he bargained. I quickly scooped up another ravioli and popped it in my mouth. \"It's harder than it should be — keeping track of you. Usually I can findsomeone very easily, once I've heard their mind before. \" He looked at meanxiously, and I realized I had frozen. I made myself swallow, thenstabbed another ravioli and tossed it in. \"I was keeping tabs on Jessica, not carefully — like I said, only youcould find trouble in Port Angeles — and at first I didn't notice whenyou took off on your own. Then, when I realized that you weren't with heranymore, I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head. Icould tell that you hadn't gone in, and that you'd gone south… and I knewyou would have to turn around soon. So I was just waiting for you,randomly searching through the thoughts of people on the street — to seeif anyone had noticed you so I would know where you were."

The sun was finallysetting, and I was about to get out and follow you on foot. And then —\"He stopped, clenching his teeth together in sudden fury. He made aneffort to calm himself. \"Then what? \" I whispered. He continued to stare over my head. \"I heard what they were thinking,\" he growled, his upper lip curlingslightly back over his teeth. \"I saw your face in his mind. \" He suddenlyleaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his hand covering hiseyes. The movement was so swift it startled me. \"It was very… hard — you can't imagine how hard — for me to simply takeyou away, and leave them… alive. \" His voice was muffled by his arm. \"Icould have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I was afraid if youleft me alone, I would go looking for them,\" he admitted in a whisper. I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in mylap, and I was leaning weakly against the back of the seat. He still hadhis face in his hand, and he was as still as if he'd been carved from thestone his skin resembled. Finally he looked up, his eyes seeking mine, full of his own questions. \"Are you ready to go home? \" he asked. \"I'm ready to leave,\" I qualified, overly grateful that we had thehour-long ride home together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to him. The waitress appeared as if she'd been called. Or watching. \"How are we doing? \" she asked Edward. \"We're ready for the check, thank you. \" His voice was quiet, rougher,still reflecting the strain of our conversation. It seemed to muddle her. He looked up, waiting. \"S-sure,\" she stuttered. \"Here you go. \" She pulled a small leather folderfrom the front pocket of her black apron and handed it to him. There was a bill in his hand already. He slipped it into the folder andhanded it right back to her. \"No change. \" He smiled. Then he stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to myfeet. She smiled invitingly at him again. \"You have a nice evening. \"He didn't look away from me as he thanked her. I suppressed a smile. He walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. Iremembered what Jessica had said about her relationship with Mike, howthey were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward seemed to hearme, and he looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful thathe didn't seem to be able to know what I was thinking. He opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shuttingit softly behind me. I watched him walk around the front of the car,amazed, yet again, by how graceful he was. I probably should have beenused to that by now — but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the\fkind of person anyone got used to. Once inside the car, he started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I guessed the good weather was at an end. Iwas warm in his jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it when Ithought he couldn't see. Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance,flipping around to head toward the freeway. \"Now,\" he said significantly, \"it's your turn. \"\n\nChapter 9 Theory\n    \"Can I ask just one more? \" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much tooquickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attentionto the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well… you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I hadgone south. I was just wondering how you knew that. \"He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent. \" He looked at the road, giving metime to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response tothat, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explainingthings. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions…\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one? \"\"How does it work — the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind,anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family… ? \" I felt silly,asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingersand gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairlyclose. The more familiar someone's… 'voice' is, the farther away I canhear them. But still, no more than a few miles. \" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyonetalking at once. It's just a hum — a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \"Most of the time I tune it all out — it can be very distracting. Andthen it's easier to seem normal\" — he frowned as he said the word — \"whenI'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than theirwords. \"\"Why do you think you can't hear me? \" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your\fmind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughtsare on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM. \" He grinned at me,suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak? \" The words bothered me morethan they should — probably because his speculation hit home. I'd alwayssuspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" helaughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory…\" His face tightened. \"Whichbrings us back to you. \"I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now? \" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. Ihappened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow! \" I shouted. \"Slow down! \"\"What's wrong? \" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour! \" I was still shouting. I shot apanicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The roadwas only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from theheadlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall— as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella. \" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us? \" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash. \"I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry? \"\"I always drive like this. \" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road! \"\"I've never been in an accident, Bella — I've never even gotten aticket. \" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector. \"\"Very funny. \" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abideby traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around atree trunk, you can probably just walk away. \"\"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't. \" Hesighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted towardeighty. \"Happy? \"\"Almost. \"\"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow? \"\"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting foryour latest theory. \"I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me. \"\"Is it that bad? \"\"Pretty much, yeah. \"He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his\fexpression. \"Go ahead. \" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning… you said you didn't come up withthis on your own. \"\"No. \"\"What got you started — a book? A movie? \" he probed. \"No — it was Saturday, at the beach. \" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend —Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad andCharlie have been friends since I was a baby. \"He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders. \" I watched him carefully. Hisconfused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk —\" I edited allmy scheming out of the story \"— and he was telling me some old legends —trying to scare me, I think. He told me one…\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires. \" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at hisface now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me? \" Still calm. \"No. He… mentioned your family. \"He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn'texpect me to think anything of it. \" It didn't seem like enough; I had toconfess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me. \"\"Why? \"\"Lauren said something about you — she was trying to provoke me. And anolder boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation,only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob aloneand I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head. He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but hiseyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how? \" he asked. \"I tried to flirt — it worked better than I thought it would. \" Disbeliefcolored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that. \" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me ofdazzling people — poor Jacob Black. \"I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then? \" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet. \"\"And did that convince you? \" His voice sounded barely interested. But hishands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then…\" I stopped. \"What? \"\"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter? \" His tone made me look up — I had finally brokenthrough his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with justa hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are. \"A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human! \"\"No. \"He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything. \"\"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather knowwhat you're thinking — even if what you're thinking is insane. \"\"So I'm wrong again? \" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'! \" he quoted,gritting his teeth together. \"I'm right? \" I gasped. \"Does it matter? \"I took a deep breath. \"Not really. \" I paused. \"But I am curious. \" My voice, at least, wascomposed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about? \"\"How old are you? \"\"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen? \"His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted atlast. \"Okay. \" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. Hestared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he wasworried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and hefrowned. \"Don't laugh — but how can you come out during the daytime? \"He laughed anyway. \"Myth. \"\"Burned by the sun? \"\"Myth. \"\"Sleeping in coffins? \"\"Myth. \" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep. \"It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all? \"\"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at mewith a wistful expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my trainof thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet. \" His voice was\fhard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold."

Me, for example, allowing myself to be alonewith you. \"\"This is a mistake? \" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't knowif he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curvesof the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like avideo game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like theblack road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never haveanother chance to be with him like this again — openly, the walls betweenus gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from theidea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so Icould hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more doyou want to know? \"\"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voicestill tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I foughtagainst the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster. \" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough? \"He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living ontofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger — or rather thirst. But it keensus strong enough to resist. Most of the time. \" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others. \"\"Is it very difficult for you now? \" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes. \"\"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently — stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that? \"\"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people — men inparticular — are crabbier when they're hungry. \"He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you? \"I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing itto memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett? \" I asked when it was quietagain. \"Yes. \" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to saysomething. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a biteasier to be around you when I'm not thirsty. \"\"Why didn't you want to leave? \"\"It makes me… anxious… to be away from you. \" His eyes were gentle butintense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn'tjoking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run overlast Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. Andafter what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through awhole weekend unscathed. \" He shook his head, and then seemed to remembersomething. \"Well, not totally unscathed. \"\"What? \"\"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at thealmost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missednothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought. \" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose,being you, it could have been much worse — and that possibility tormentedme the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I reallygot on Emmett's nerves. \" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today? \"\"No, we got back Sunday. \"\"Then why weren't any of you in school? \" I was frustrated, almost angryas I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of hisabsence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't.

His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'mdangerous, Bella — please, grasp that. \"\"No. \" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late. \"His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that. \"I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I staredout at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast. \"What are you thinking? \" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook myhead, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but Ikept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying? \" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture inmy eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, andsure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me. \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then hestopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry. \" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't justapologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear himstruggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes? \"\"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? Icouldn't understand your expression — you didn't look that scared, youlooked like you were concentrating very hard on something. \"\"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker — you know,self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain. \" I thought ofthe dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them? \" This upset him. \"Didn't you think aboutrunning? \"\"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help? \"\"I was getting to that part. \"He shook his head. \"You were right — I'm definitely fighting fate tryingto keep you alive. \"\fI sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It hadtaken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow? \" I demanded. \"Yes — I have a paper due, too. \" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat atlunch. \"It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that littlepromise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in itsplace, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. Hestopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow? \"\"I promise. \"I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off,taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it — you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie. \"\"Oh, right. \" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella? \" he asked in a different tone — serious, but hesitant. \"Yes? \" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something? \"\"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. Whatif he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone. \"I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why? \"He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it atthat. \"I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I wasrelieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever yousay. \"\"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then. \" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella? \" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious facejust inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It wasthe same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a moreconcentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. ThenI stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to becertain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard hisengine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around thecorner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella? \"\"Yeah, Dad, it's me. \" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseballgame. \"You're home early. \"\"Am I? \" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun? \"\"Yeah — it was lots of fun. \" My head was spinning as I tried to rememberall the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both founddresses. \"\"Are you all right? \"\"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking. \"\"Well, maybe you should go lie down. \" He sounded concerned. I wonderedwhat my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first. \"\"Weren't you just with her? \" he asked, surprised. \"Yes — but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings ittomorrow. \"\"Well, give her a chance to get home first. \"\"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was reallyfeeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello? \" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella? \"\"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you. \"\"You made it home? \" Her voice was relieved… and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car — could you bring it to me tomorrow? \"\"Sure. But tell me what happened! \" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow — in Trig, okay? \"She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there? \"\"Yes, that's right. \"\"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye! \" I could hear the impatiencein her voice. \"Bye, Jess. \"I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I wentthrough the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attentionto what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower — the water toohot, burning my skin — that I realized I was freezing. I shudderedviolently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finallyrelax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move,until the hot water began to run out."

                "text": "I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold theheat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressedfor bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, huggingmyself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, andsome I fought to repress. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fellgradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was avampire. Second, there was part of him — and I didn't know how potentthat part might be — that thirsted for my blood. And third, I wasunconditionally and irrevocably in love with him. Chapter 10 Interrogations\n    It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that wassure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. Iclung to the parts I couldn't have imagined — like his smell. I was sureI could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had noreason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes,remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again — I was running later thanI'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it downwith milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist wasice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. Icouldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fogthat I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a carin it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked upagain in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling thedoor open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today? \" he asked, amused by my expression ashe caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice — I was free to refuse, and part of himhoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped intothe warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of thepassenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should bepossible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick orsomething. \" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jackethimself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again,the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossaltribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto mylap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if thescent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you? \" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meantfor me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feelingawkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down… almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left metongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today? \"\"Do my questions bother you? \" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do. \" He looked like he was joking, but Icouldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly? \"\"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly — it's unnatural. It makes me wonder what you're really thinking. \"\"I always tell you what I'm really thinking. \"\"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much. \"\"Enough to drive me insane. \"\"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as thewords were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; Icould only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face wasunreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred tome belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family? \" I asked — more than glad to be alonewith him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car. \" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy redconvertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it? \"\"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you? \"\"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in. \"\"You don't succeed. \" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of thecar. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to schoolin plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's moreconspicuous? \"\"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now. \" He met me at thefront of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but Iwas afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all? \" I wondered aloud. \"If you'relooking for privacy? \"\"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drivefast. \"\"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting,her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, wasmy jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks forremembering. \" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his faultthat his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of. \"Er… hi. \" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbledthoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig. \" She gave me a meaningful look,and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then. \"She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her? \" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind! \" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers — she'll be waiting to ambush you in class. \"I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing itwith my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her? \"\"A little help? \" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know? \"He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair. \"\"No, you not sharing what you know — now that's not fair. \"He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door tomy first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know howyou feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say? \" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I wasbarely aware of them. \"Hmmm. \" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping thetwist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart splutteredhyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first… if you don'tmind — it's easier than any other explanation. \"\"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question… well, I'll be listening to hear theanswer to that one myself. \" One side of his mouth pulled up into myfavorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respondto that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three peoplewalking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now Iwas even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat inmy usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to seean odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles? \"\"It was…\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finishedlamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress. \"\"Did she say anything about Monday night? \" he asked, his eyesbrightening. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did? \" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely. \"Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in ourpapers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worriedabout how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether Edwardwould really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess'sthoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be — when it\fwasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the daywas still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sittingin the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantlywent to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to getit over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything! \" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know? \" I hedged. \"What happened last night? \"\"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home. \"She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you gethome so fast? \"\"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying. \" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date — did you tell him to meet you there? \"I hadn't thought of that. \"No — I was very surprised to see him there. \"Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in myvoice. \"But he picked you up for school today? \" she probed. \"Yes — that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket lastnight,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again? \"\"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truckisn't up to it — does that count? \"\"Yes. \" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes. \"\"W-o-w. \" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen. \"\"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait! \" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you? \"\"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that. \"She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday… ? \" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it. \" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about? \" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and weweren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked aboutthe English essay a little. \" A very, very little. I think he mentioned itin passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details. \"\"Well… okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirtingwith him — it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her atall. \" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty? \"\"Very — and probably nineteen or twenty. \"\"Even better. He must like you. \"\"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw infor his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why? \" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so… intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him. \" She made aface, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turnedthe overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous. \" Jessica shrugged as if thisexcused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that. \"\"Really? Like what? \"I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd beenkidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right… but he's even more unbelievable behind theface."

As I jumped up out of my seat, shovingmy books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tippedJessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you? \" she guessed. \"I don't think so. \" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappearinconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall —looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to — Edward waswaiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella. \" Her voice was thick with implications. I mighthave to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello. \" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had beenlistening, it was obvious. \"Hi. \"I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak — bidinghis time, I presumed — so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walkingwith Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my firstday here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyesreturned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. Itseemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as thedominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on myjacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing? \" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me? \"He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course. \"I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From theother end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazementas we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in myhands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food? \"\"You're always curious. \" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me,holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, anddeliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. Iwatched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you? \" he askedcondescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once… on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't sobad. \"He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised. \" Something over my shoulderseemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do — she'll break it down for youlater. \" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessicabrought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowinghe was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she? \" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice? \"\"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind. \"\"Poor girl. \" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica… well, it bothers me. \" He refused to bedistracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lasheswith troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know whatthey say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening. \"\"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking. \"\"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren'tprecisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking —everything. I just wish… that you wouldn't be thinking some things. \"I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction. \"\"But that's not really the point at the moment. \"\"Then what is? \" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, myright hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were ina crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was tooeasy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you? \" hemurmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came backto me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What? \"\"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh. \" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it. \"\"Are you going to answer the question? \"I looked down. \"Yes. \"\"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that? \" He wasirritated again. \"Yes, I really think that. \" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyestracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. Thesilence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it thistime, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong. \"I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head indoubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly tobelieve them. \"What makes you think so? \" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating —trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to findsome way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him gettingimpatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted myhand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he wassatisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table,moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared atmy hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes…\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure— I don't know how to read minds — but sometimes it seems like you'retrying to say goodbye when you're saying something else. \" That was thebest I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered inme at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing ashe confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he beganto explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'? \"\"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'mabsolutely ordinary — well, except for bad things like all the near-deathexperiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look atyou. \" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took ona knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'lladmit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but youdidn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on yourfirst day. \"I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it…\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once — you are the opposite of ordinary. \"My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that cameinto his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my originalargument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because ifI can do it\" — he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought —\"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep fromhurting you, to keep you safe. \"I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same? \"\"You'd never have to make the choice. \"Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous,devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safeis beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires myconstant presence. \"\"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful forthe lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. IfI had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keephim close… I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on myface. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to beexpecting disasters. \"I have another question for you. \" His face was still casual. \"Shoot. \"\"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just anexcuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers? \"\fI made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for theTyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deludedhimself into thinking I'm going to prom with him. \"\"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me — I just reallywanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if hislaughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turnedme down? \" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later — faked anillness or a sprained ankle. \"He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that? \"I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I wouldhave thought you would understand. \"\"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stablesurface without finding something to trip over? \"\"Obviously. \"\"That wouldn't be a problem. \" He was very confident. \"It's all in theleading. \" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me — are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do youmind if we do something different? \"As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask. \"He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What? \"\"Can I drive? \"He frowned. \"Why? \"\"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, hespecifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If heasked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will askagain, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subjectunnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me. \"He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you,you worry about my driving. \" He shook his head in disgust, but then hiseyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you'respending the day with me? \" There was an undercurrent to his question thatI didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more. \" I was definite about that. \"Whereare we going, anyway? \"\"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye… andyou can stay with me, if you'd like to. \" Again, he was leaving the choiceup to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun? \" I asked, excited bythe idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes. \" He smiled, and then paused."

I shudderto think of the trouble you could find in a city that size. \"I was miffed. \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle — just inpopulation. In physical size —\"\"But apparently,\" he interrupted me, \"your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near me. \" His eyes did that unfair smolderingthing again. I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a mootpoint anyway. \"As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you. \"\"I know,\" he sighed, brooding. \"You should tell Charlie, though. \"\"Why in the world would I do that? \"His eyes were suddenly fierce. \"To give me some small incentive to bringyou back. \"I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. \"I think I'll takemy chances. \"He exhaled angrily, and looked away. \"Let's talk about something else,\" I suggested. \"What do you want to talk about? \" he asked. He was still annoyed. I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. AsI cast my eyes around the room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice,staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly,back to him, and I. asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend… to hunt? Charliesaid it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears. \"He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears? \" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" Iadded sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" heinformed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears? \" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite. \" His voice was still offhand, but his eyeswere scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. Ichewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite? \"He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down indisapproval. \"Mountain lion. \"\"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be carefulnot to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focuson areas with an overpopulation of predators — ranging as far away as weneed. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, butwhere's the fun in that? \" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season — they're just coming outof hibernation, so they're more irritable. \" He smiled at some rememberedjoke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking,please. \"\"I'm trying to picture it — but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt abear without weapons? \"\f\"Oh, we have weapons. \" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief,threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you'veever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualizeEmmett hunting. \"I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peekedacross the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking myway. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso weresomehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too? \" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps ourpreferences are indicative. \"I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled withopposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something Imight get to see? \"\"Absolutely not! \" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyeswere suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and — though I'd neveradmit it to him — frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well,folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me? \" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voicecutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be morebeneficial for you. \"\"Then why? \" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. \"We're going to be late. \"I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria wasnearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such amuddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbingmy bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget. Chapter 11 Complications\n    Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticedthat he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the deskwould allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almosttouching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then — what superb timing the man had —pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdatedTV and VCR. A movie day — the lift in the class atmosphere was almosttangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wallto turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edwardwas sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected\felectricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to bemore aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over andtouch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearlyoverwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my handsballing into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes,of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realizedhis posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, rightdown to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyessomehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before Icould start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I shouldfeel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie — I didn'teven know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, butthe electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in hisbody never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glancein his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpoweringcraving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safelyagainst my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on atthe end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing mystiff fingers. Edward chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and hiseyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we? \" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balancemight have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turnedto say goodbye. His face startled me — his expression was torn, almostpained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared asstrong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and thenswiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skinwas as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin wasalarmingly warm — like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of ityet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the lockerroom, changing in a trancelike state, only vaguely aware that there wereother people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I washanded a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. Icould see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. CoachClapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came tostand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team? \"\"Thanks, Mike — you don't have to do this, you know. \" I grimacedapologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way. \" He grinned. Sometimes it was soeasy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head withmy racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest ofthe hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behindmy back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he wonthree games out of four singlehandedly. He gave me an unearned high five\fwhen the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what? \"\"You and Cullen, huh? \" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feelingof affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursingJessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like… like you're something to eat,\" he continued,ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small gigglemanaged to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved andfled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies batteringrecklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike alreadya distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if Ishould meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a waveof real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know thatthey knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walkstraight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worrieswere unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the sideof the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to hisside, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello. \" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym? \"My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really? \" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly,looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike'sback as he walked away. \"What? \" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves. \"\"You weren't listening again? \" I was horror-struck. All traces of mysudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head? \" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable! \" I turned, stomping away in the general directionof the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym — it mademe curious. \" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence — a furious, embarrassed silence on my part — to hiscar. But I had to stop a few steps away — a crowd of people, all boys,were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actuallycircled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in theireyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open hisdoor. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that? \" I asked. \"An M3. \"\"I don't speak Car and Driver. \"\"It's a BMW. \" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back outwithout running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded — I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry? \" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely. \"He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize? \"\"Maybe… if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" Iinsisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree tolet you drive Saturday? \" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you."

My previous feelingof affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursingJessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like… like you're something to eat,\" he continued,ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small gigglemanaged to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved andfled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies batteringrecklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike alreadya distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if Ishould meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a waveof real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know thatthey knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walkstraight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worrieswere unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the sideof the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to hisside, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello. \" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym? \"My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really? \" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly,looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike'sback as he walked away. \"What? \" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves. \"\"You weren't listening again? \" I was horror-struck. All traces of mysudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head? \" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable! \" I turned, stomping away in the general directionof the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym — it mademe curious. \" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence — a furious, embarrassed silence on my part — to hiscar. But I had to stop a few steps away — a crowd of people, all boys,were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actuallycircled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in theireyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open hisdoor. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that? \" I asked. \"An M3. \"\"I don't speak Car and Driver. \"\"It's a BMW. \" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back outwithout running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded — I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry? \" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely. \"He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize? \"\"Maybe… if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" Iinsisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree tolet you drive Saturday? \" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you."

I'll be there, no car. \"I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet? \" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later. \"I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised — of course we were already atCharlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with himif I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he wasstaring at me, measuring with his eyes. \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt? \" He seemed solemn,but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction. \"\"Did I frighten you? \" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but thenall evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of youbeing there… while we hunted. \" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad? \"He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely. \"\f\"Because… ? \"He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick,rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over toour senses… govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. Ifyou were anywhere near me when I lost control that way…\" He shook hishead, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash ofhis eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothingaway. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened — and changed. Flickers ofthe electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere ashe gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started toswim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath,breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now. \" His low voice was rough, hiseyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helpedclear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I steppedcarefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without lookingback. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella? \" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned towardthe open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes? \"\"Tomorrow it's my turn. \"\"Your turn to what? \"He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions. \"And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearingaround the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as Iwalked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, ifnothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate ofmy unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricitythat had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly,waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that Ifinally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brownturtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed ofspaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event Iexpected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. Iwondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspokenquestion as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday…\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turningon the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad? \"\"Are you still set on going to Seattle? \" he asked. \"That was the plan. \" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so Iwouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with thebrush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance? \"\"I'm not going to the dance, Dad. \" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you? \" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusingon rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice. \"\"Oh. \" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; livingin fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having toworry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, ifCharlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush myteeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I couldonly wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silvercar was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. Ibounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long thisbizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end. He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind mewithout bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausingshyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed —and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning. \" His voice was silky. \"How are you today? \" His eyes roamedover my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you. \" I was always good — much more than good — when I wasnear him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired. \"\"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around myshoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becomingused to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me,whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bitmore than you did. \"\"I'd wager you did. \"\"So what did you do last night? \" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions. \"\"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know? \" My forehead creased. Icouldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interestingto him. \"What's your favorite color? \" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day. \"\"What's your favorite color today? \" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown. \" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown? \" he askedskeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to bebrown — tree trunks, rocks, dirt — is all covered up with squashy greenstuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment,staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm. \" He reachedover, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind\fmy shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into aparking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now? \" he asked, his face as somberas if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said thename of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out oneof thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed itto me,\"Debussy to this? \" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyesdown. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me toEnglish, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, hequestioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of myexistence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and themany places I wanted to go, and books — endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often thannot, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But theabsolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream ofquestions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, onlya very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it broughton a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topazbefore thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed thatI felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answerwith the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would havecontinued down whatever mental list he was following, except for theblush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favoritegemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topazeyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, hewouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed — failed onlybecause I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring downat my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you askedme in two weeks I'd say onyx. \" I'd given more information than necessaryin my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange angerthat flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed Iwas. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer? \" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzingup until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frameagain. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slidehis chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as theroom was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restlesscraving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his coldskin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, myhidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore theirrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid thatif he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that muchharder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hourI had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was lookingat me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked towardthe gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touchedmy face wordlessly — this time with the back of his cool hand, strokingonce from my temple to my jaw — before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn'tspeak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or becausehe was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a cornerof my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved,the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy thanusual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same releasewhen I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreadingacross my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into morecross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. Hewanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions ofanything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house forhours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a suddendeluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote —bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant — the high, keening soundof the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the verysize of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barelyinterrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. Thehardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me — to justify abeauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that oftenlooked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape ofthe land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, andthe way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I triedto describe it to him."

I looked out atthe rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it? \" Iwondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time— Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon,obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mindwere somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out thewindshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspokenquestion in my eyes. \"The easiest time.

The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a darkcar pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour atthe other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain waslouder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but itwas too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the newcar's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked onsomething or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix offrustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wetpavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side ofthe little black car. \"Jacob? \" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie'scruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants ofthe car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through thedarkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man witha memorable face — a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against hisshoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an oldleather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes thatseemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad facethey were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately,though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed toforget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He wasstaring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. Hiseyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smilefaded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groanedinternally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he reallybelieve the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could. Chapter 12 Balancing\n    \"Billy! \" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under theporch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he saiddisapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the doorand flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow. \" I recognized Billy's resonant voiceeasily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger,a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lightsbefore I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiouslyas Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off therain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time. \" Hisdark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game. \"Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan — our TV broke last week. \"Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to seeBella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I foughtback a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry? \" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager toescape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie? \" I called over my shoulder as I fled around thecorner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front roomand the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing upa tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things? \" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good. \" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How aboutyou? Did you finish your car? \"\"No. \" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one. \" He pointedwith his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any… what was it you were looking for? \"\"Master cylinder. \" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck? \" headded suddenly. \"No. \"\f\"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it. \"I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check thebottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend. \"\"Nice ride. \" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver,though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here. \"I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere. \"\"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over thesink. \"\"Sure. \"He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it? \" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen. \"To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a littleembarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad wasacting so strange. \"\"That's right. \" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like theCullens. \"\"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie? \" I couldn't help asking,the words coming out in a low rush. Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression inhis dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewedhim out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since — tonightis sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again. \"\"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie,pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was reallylistening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy wasabout to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but Iwas afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon? \" Jacob asked ashe pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night. \" His eyesshifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" headded seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in theliving room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day? \"\"Good. \" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching fordetails I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games. \"\"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton. \"\"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted. \"Who is it? \" he asked with token interest. \"Um… Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah — you said you were friends with the Newton kid. \" He perked up. \"Nice family. \" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to thedance this weekend? \"\"Dad! \" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, youknow I can't dance. \"\"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guessit's good you'll be gone Saturday… I've made plans to go fishing with theguys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if youwanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stayhome. I know I leave you here alone too much. \"\"Dad, you're doing a great job. \" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone — I'm too much like you. \" I winked at him,and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to thepearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billyand Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely. I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hairback into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday. \"I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bagready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door assoon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. Hewas waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, thesooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping mybreath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any moreglorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep? \" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea howappealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night? \"\"Pleasant. \" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an insidejoke. \"Can I ask what you did? \" I asked. \"No. \" He grinned. \"Today is still mine. \"He wanted to know about people today: more about Renée, her hobbies, whatwe'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd\fknown, my few school friends — embarrassing me when he asked about boysI'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so thatparticular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised asJessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted? \" he asked in a serious tone thatmade me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix. \"His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blurthat was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause totake a bite of my bagel."

We'llgo get your truck and leave it here for you. \"\"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking. \"What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in theignition — unless you're afraid someone might steal it. \" He laughed atthe thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was inthe pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothesin the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he wasplanning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in myconsent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going? \" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with youtomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can. \" His face grewmorose… and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know. \"I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused tobe convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. Itdoesn't matter, I repeated in my head. \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't. \"\"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken incolor as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow? \" I asked,already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends… it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in? \" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile. \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there? \"\"No, he's fishing tomorrow. \" I beamed at the memory of how convenientlythings had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think? \"\"I have no idea,\" I answered coolly. \"He knows I've been meaning to do\fthe laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer. \"He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressivethan mine. \"What are you hunting tonight? \" I asked when I was sure I had lost theglowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far. \" He seemed bemused bymy casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice? \" I wondered. \"Alice is the most… supportive. \" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others? \" I asked timidly. \"What are they? \"His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part. \"I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off indifferent directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother satacross from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"Theydon't understand why I can't leave you alone. \"I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter. \"Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling beforehe met my gaze again. \"I told you — you don't see yourself clearly atall. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me. \"I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\"he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better thanaverage grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you… you neverdo what I expect. You always take me by surprise. \"I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed anddissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wantedto laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes onmy face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrinin my eyes. \"But there's more… and it's not so easy to put into words —\"I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, hisblond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look — toglare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held meuntil Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under hisbreath. It was almost a hiss. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back atEdward — and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened myeyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's justworried. You see… it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spendingso much time with you so publicly…\" He looked down. \"If? \"\"If this ends… badly. \" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had thatnight in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him,but I was at a loss to know how. My hand reached toward himinvoluntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing thatmy touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his wordsshould frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem\fto feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration — frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever hewas about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still hadhis head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now? \"\"Yes. \" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his moodshifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteenminutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology — I don't thinkI could take any more. \"I started. Alice — her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarrayaround her exquisite, elfin face — was suddenly standing behind hisshoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolutestillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice. \"\"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive ashis. \"Alice, Bella — Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually withhis hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella. \" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but hersmile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you. \"Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready? \" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car. \"She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that Ifelt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment? \" I asked,turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything. \" He grinned. \"Have fun, then. \" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't foolhim. \"I'll try. \" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please. \"\"Safe in Forks — what a challenge. \"\"For you it is a challenge. \" His jaw hardened. \"Promise. \"\"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight —that ought to be fraught with peril. \"\"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best. \"He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it? \" he mused. I nodded glumly. \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along mycheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until\fhe was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym,but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mikeand others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried aboutthe time we'd spent together publicly… if things went wrong. I refused todwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things saferfor him. I intuitively knew — and sensed he did, too — that tomorrow would bepivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on thepoint of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, dependingentirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, madebefore I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing itthrough. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, moreexcruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was animpossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happenedin Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. InGym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck. \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen? \" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all. \"\"What are you doing, then? \" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going tofail. \"\"Is Cullen helping you study? \"\"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone awaysomewhere for the weekend. \" The lies came more naturally than usual, Inoted with surprise. \"Oh. \" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our groupanyway — that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay? \"\"Fine. \" He sulked again. \"I was just offering. \"When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lotwithout enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but Icouldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck. Then again, I wasstarting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latterinstinct proved correct — my truck sat in the same space he'd parked hisVolvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened theunlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closedthe door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegantscript. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead boltunlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight tothe laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug formy jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'dhung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I calledJessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When sheoffered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about thecancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for athird-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, Iguessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoyingthe lasagna — it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad…\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell? \"\"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica orsomeone else can go with me. \"\"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home? \"\"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do…homework, laundry… I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day… you go and have fun. \"\"Are you sure? \"\"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish— we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply. \"\"You're sure easy to live with, Bella. \" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of mylaughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty fordeceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where Iwould be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My minddefinitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control."

We'llgo get your truck and leave it here for you. \"\"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking. \"What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in theignition — unless you're afraid someone might steal it. \" He laughed atthe thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was inthe pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothesin the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he wasplanning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in myconsent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going? \" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with youtomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can. \" His face grewmorose… and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know. \"I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused tobe convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. Itdoesn't matter, I repeated in my head. \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't. \"\"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken incolor as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow? \" I asked,already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends… it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in? \" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile. \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there? \"\"No, he's fishing tomorrow. \" I beamed at the memory of how convenientlythings had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think? \"\"I have no idea,\" I answered coolly. \"He knows I've been meaning to do\fthe laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer. \"He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressivethan mine. \"What are you hunting tonight? \" I asked when I was sure I had lost theglowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far. \" He seemed bemused bymy casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice? \" I wondered. \"Alice is the most… supportive. \" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others? \" I asked timidly. \"What are they? \"His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part. \"I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off indifferent directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother satacross from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"Theydon't understand why I can't leave you alone. \"I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter. \"Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling beforehe met my gaze again. \"I told you — you don't see yourself clearly atall. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me. \"I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\"he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better thanaverage grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you… you neverdo what I expect. You always take me by surprise. \"I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed anddissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wantedto laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes onmy face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrinin my eyes. \"But there's more… and it's not so easy to put into words —\"I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, hisblond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look — toglare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held meuntil Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under hisbreath. It was almost a hiss. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back atEdward — and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened myeyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's justworried. You see… it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spendingso much time with you so publicly…\" He looked down. \"If? \"\"If this ends… badly. \" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had thatnight in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him,but I was at a loss to know how. My hand reached toward himinvoluntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing thatmy touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his wordsshould frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem\fto feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration — frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever hewas about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still hadhis head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now? \"\"Yes. \" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his moodshifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteenminutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology — I don't thinkI could take any more. \"I started. Alice — her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarrayaround her exquisite, elfin face — was suddenly standing behind hisshoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolutestillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice. \"\"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive ashis. \"Alice, Bella — Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually withhis hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella. \" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but hersmile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you. \"Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready? \" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car. \"She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that Ifelt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment? \" I asked,turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything. \" He grinned. \"Have fun, then. \" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't foolhim. \"I'll try. \" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please. \"\"Safe in Forks — what a challenge. \"\"For you it is a challenge. \" His jaw hardened. \"Promise. \"\"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight —that ought to be fraught with peril. \"\"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best. \"He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it? \" he mused. I nodded glumly. \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along mycheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until\fhe was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym,but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mikeand others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried aboutthe time we'd spent together publicly… if things went wrong. I refused todwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things saferfor him. I intuitively knew — and sensed he did, too — that tomorrow would bepivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on thepoint of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, dependingentirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, madebefore I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing itthrough. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, moreexcruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was animpossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happenedin Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. InGym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck. \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen? \" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all. \"\"What are you doing, then? \" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going tofail. \"\"Is Cullen helping you study? \"\"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone awaysomewhere for the weekend. \" The lies came more naturally than usual, Inoted with surprise. \"Oh. \" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our groupanyway — that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay? \"\"Fine. \" He sulked again. \"I was just offering. \"When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lotwithout enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but Icouldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck. Then again, I wasstarting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latterinstinct proved correct — my truck sat in the same space he'd parked hisVolvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened theunlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closedthe door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegantscript. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead boltunlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight tothe laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug formy jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'dhung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I calledJessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When sheoffered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about thecancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for athird-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, Iguessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoyingthe lasagna — it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad…\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell? \"\"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica orsomeone else can go with me. \"\"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home? \"\"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do…homework, laundry… I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day… you go and have fun. \"\"Are you sure? \"\"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish— we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply. \"\"You're sure easy to live with, Bella. \" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of mylaughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty fordeceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where Iwould be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My minddefinitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control."

I had to keep remindingmyself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulledhis note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb thetwo small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself againand again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, thatdesire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice — tocut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, itreally seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it wouldhurt very much… if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. Iknew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never donebefore. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine — the kind thatknocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone thattype of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enoughwithout me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till itwas impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. Witheverything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper;I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDsuntil I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on veryquietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individualparts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the coldpills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness. I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to mygratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back intothe same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush,\fsmoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater tillit hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to seethat Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled thesky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I wasdone. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had justfinished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quietknock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, butI yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitationdissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. Ibreathed a sigh of relief — yesterday's fears seemed very foolish withhim here. He wasn't smiling at first — his face was somber. But then his expressionlightened as he looked me over, and he laughed. \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong? \" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anythingimportant, like shoes, or pants. \"We match. \" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweateron, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughedwith him, hiding a secret twinge of regret — why did he have to look likea runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited bythe passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat,and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to? \" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on — I'm nervous already. \"I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to? \" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-oh-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feelinghis gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usualthrough the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall? \"\"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather — have somerespect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thickunderbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. Iobeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends. \"I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving offthe road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end? \" I wondered. \"A trail. \"\"We're hiking? \" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem? \" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No. \" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truckwas slow…\"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry. \"Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack inpanic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twistmy ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking? \" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going. \"\"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice. \" We both glanced outthe windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today. \"\"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to? \" he asked. \"Nope. \"\"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together? \" He seemed cheeredby the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me — which is true. \"\"No one knows you're with me? \" Angrily, now. \"That depends… I assume you told Alice? \"\"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal? \" he demandedwhen I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you… us being together publicly,\" Ireminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me— if you don't comehome? \" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that Icouldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves ofinfuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothingto say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a smallwooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraidbecause he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse notto look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks sincethe day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off mysweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light,sleeveless shirt — especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed hissweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest besidemy truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes stillannoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail? \" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to\fcatch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were takingit. \"\"No trail? \" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost. \" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and Istifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore itunbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat floweduninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfectmusculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He wastoo perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no waythis godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home? \" he said quietly, a different pain than minesaturating his voice. \"No. \" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to wasteone second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong? \" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered dully. \"You'll have to be verypatient. \"\"I can be patient — if I make a great effort. \" He smiled, holding myglance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized myface. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise wasunconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thoughtit was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the oneperson whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown,you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me,struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he heldthe damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path tookus over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by theelbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touchon my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, whenthat happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he couldsomehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, butI slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask arandom question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days ofinterrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, mychildhood pets — and I had to admit that after killing three fish in arow, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louderthan I was used to — bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the emptywoods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign ofimpatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth ofancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our wayout again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, neverseeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopytransformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day\fhad turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'dentered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement — which quickly turnedto impatience. \"Are we there yet? \" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly. \" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightnessahead? \"I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I? \"He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes. \"\"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew morepronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see alightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. Ipicked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me leadnow, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the lastfringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow wassmall, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers — violet, yellow, andsoft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of astream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze ofbuttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass,swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to sharethis with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spunaround, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, stillunder the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watchingme with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of themeadow had driven from my mind — the enigma of Edward and the sun, whichhe'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyeswere wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with myhand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, andI hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into thebright glow of the midday sun. Chapter 13 Confessions\n   Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, thoughI'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faintflush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousandsof tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface."

                "text": "He lay perfectly still inthe grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, hisscintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut,though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in someunknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they weretrembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; itwas too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for mytaste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm myface. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling totake my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffledthe grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like amirage, too beautiful to be real… hesitantly, I reached out one fingerand stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within myreach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool asstone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turnedup the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you? \" he asked playfully, but I could hear the realcuriosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual. \"He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours ofhis forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knewit wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind? \" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how thatfeels. \" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followedthe faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With myother hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, heflipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcertingmovements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a briefsecond. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes closeagain. \"It's too easy to be myself with you. \"I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sunglitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see thehidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyeswatching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing. \"\"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time. \"\"It's a hard life. \" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"Butyou didn't tell me. \"\"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking…\" I hesitated. \"And? \"\"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishingthat I wasn't afraid. \"\"I don't want you to be afraid. \" His voice was just a soft murmur. Iheard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid,that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainlysomething to think about. \"So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up onhis right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was onlya few inches from mine. I might have — should have — flinched away fromhis unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move. His golden eyesmesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then? \" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his coolbreath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. Itwas unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer,\finhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyesto focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the smallmeadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyesdark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm… sorry… Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitiveears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. Hestopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground,crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine. He took two deep breaths,and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry. \" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant ifI said I was only human? \"I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsedthrough my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He couldsmell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites youin — my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that! \"Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight,only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadowin half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlesslyripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balancedit in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed,shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at theblow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'dnever seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human… or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, Isat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the secondspassed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancientsadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionallyseductive. \"I promise…\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you. \" Heseemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, withexaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurriedmovements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caughtme off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now. \"He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly. \" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right? \" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully,to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft,repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned totracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiledtimidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely? \" he asked in the gentlecadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember. \"He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about whyyou were afraid, besides the obvious reason. \"\"Oh, right. \"\"Well? \"I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth,iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptlygrasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As manyyears of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. Itook courage from that thought. \"I was afraid… because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay withyou. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than Ishould. \" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for meto say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest. \"I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But Idon't know if I can. \"\"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially aselfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should. \"\"I'm glad. \"\"Don't be! \" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice washarsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any humanvoice. It was hard to keep up — his sudden mood changes left me always astep behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I ammore dangerous to you than I am to anyone else. \" He stopped, and I lookedto see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean — by that last partanyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain? \" he mused. \"And without frightening you again… hmmmm. \"Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; Iheld it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth. \" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors? \" he began. \"Some peoplelove chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry? \"I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy — I couldn't think of another way toexplain. \"I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If youlocked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy,the rarest, finest cognac — and filled the room with its warm aroma — howdo you think he would fare then? \"We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes — trying to read eachother's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy toturn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroinaddict instead. \"\"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin? \" I teased, trying tolighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactlymy brand of heroin. \"\"Does that happen often? \" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it. \" He still stared into the distance. \"ToJasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to joinour family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had timeto grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor. \" He glancedswiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me,or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try toat least. Just explain however you can. \"He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" — hehesitated, looking for the right word — \"appealing as you are to me. Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so tospeak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, oncestronger than the other. \"\"And for you? \"\"Never. \"The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do? \" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenchedinto a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going toanswer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we? \"\"What are you asking? My permission? \" My voice was sharper than I'dintended. I tried to make my tone kinder — I could guess what his honestymust cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then? \" How calmly I coulddiscuss my own death! \"No, no! \" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope!"

But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time,all I could think was, 'Not her. '\"He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, moreeager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead,I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassionfor his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital? \"His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled.

You don'tknow how it's tortured me. \" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thoughtof you, still, white, cold… to never see you blush scarlet again, tonever see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through mypretenses… it would be unendurable. \" He lifted his glorious, agonized\feyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The mostimportant thing to me ever. \"My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversationhad taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we weresuddenly declaring ourselves.

Our eyes met, and I laughed,too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such amoment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…\" he murmured. I looked away,hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion. \" He stared into the shadowy forest for along moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why… ? \" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth. \"Yes? \"\"Tell me why you ran from me before. \"His smile faded. \"You know why. \"\"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard,you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, forexample\" — I stroked the back of his hand — \"seems to be all right. \"He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault. \"\"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you. \"\"Well…\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by ouralienness… I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of yourthroat. \" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tenseatmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure. \"It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise thananything else. \"He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. Isat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning — a warningtelling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. Therewere, however, other feelings…\"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine. \"My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this mustmake everything so much more difficult — the thudding of my pulse in myveins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed hisother hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek,then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Thenabruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow atthe base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and windplay in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. Ishivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause asthey softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. Hecame to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours. Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speakagain as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and mylife could end — so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn'tmake myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he wastouching me. And then, too soon, he released me. His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you? \"\"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you? \"\"No, it wasn't bad… for me. \"He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean. \"I smiled. \"Here. \" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel howwarm it is? \"And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for Iwas touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since thefirst day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became asimmobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpectedmove. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purpleshadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfectnose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under myhand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to leanin, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, notwanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear,but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send mypulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the… complexity… theconfusion… I feel. That you could understand. \"He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face."

I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours. Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speakagain as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and mylife could end — so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn'tmake myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he wastouching me. And then, too soon, he released me. His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you? \"\"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you? \"\"No, it wasn't bad… for me. \"He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean. \"I smiled. \"Here. \" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel howwarm it is? \"And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for Iwas touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since thefirst day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became asimmobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpectedmove. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purpleshadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfectnose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under myhand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to leanin, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, notwanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear,but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send mypulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the… complexity… theconfusion… I feel. That you could understand. \"He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face."

I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairsto my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and thensprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out intothe night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of thetrees. \"Edward? \" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes? \"I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, hisfeet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh! \" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor. \"I'm sorry. \" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart. \"He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forwardand reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of myarms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart? \"\"You tell me — I'm sure you hear it better than I do. \"I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeatslow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in thehouse. \"Can I have a minute to be human? \" I asked. \"Certainly. \" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am. \" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of mybed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletriesoff the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged thebathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough andspeedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the showercouldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the sameperson I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sittingin my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with thecalming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water,toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and graysweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silkpajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags onthem in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brushthrough it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush andtoothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie couldsee that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad. \"\"'Night, Bella. \" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that wouldkeep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into myroom, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched onmy faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming tolife. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. Heraised one eyebrow. \"Nice. \"I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you. \"\"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-leggedbeside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for? \"\"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out. \"\"Oh. \" He contemplated that. \"Why? \" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mindmuch more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited. \"He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually. \"He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. Iheld perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm…\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherentquestion. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be… much easier for you, now, to be close to me. \"\"Does it seem that way to you? \" he murmured, his nose gliding to thecorner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushingmy damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm. \"\f\"So I was wondering…\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracingmy collarbone, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes? \" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think? \"I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind overmatter. \"I pulled back; as I moved, he froze — and I could no longer hear thesound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as hisclenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong? \"\"No — the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained. He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really? \" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause? \" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred yearsor so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. Ididn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with… in anotherway than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's allnew to me, that I'm good at it… at being with you…\"\"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now? \" I pressed. \"This afternoon…\"\"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still… undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so. \"\"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you. \" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"Iwasn't sure if I was strong enough…\" He picked up one of my hands andpressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still thatpossibility that I might be… overcome\" — he breathed in the scent at mywrist — \"I was… susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strongenough, that there was no possibility at all that I would… that I evercould…\"I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so… human. \"So there's no possibility now? \"\"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in thedarkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but stillexuberantly. \"Easy for you! \" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be… toomuch, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave. \"\fI scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent ofyou in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'maway from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Notquite from scratch, though, I think. \"\"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in myvoice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles — I'm your prisoner. \" But his long hands formedmanacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musicallaugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'dspent with him. \"You seem more… optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen youlike this before. \"\"Isn't it supposed to be like this? \" He smiled. \"The glory of first love,and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between readingabout something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it? \"\"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined. \"\"For example\" — his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate tocatch it all — \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundredthousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays andmovies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shockedme…\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to thedance? \"I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The dayyou started talking to me again. \"\"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt — Ididn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated thanusual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew Ihad no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in thedarkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, towatch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching theannoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, whilewatching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral,ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as Ishould, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that somedayyou would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. Youspoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled overrestlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling thatcoursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn'tignore you any longer. \" He was silent for a moment, probably listening tothe suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy… it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I wouldhave thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about thatvile Mike Newton…\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course. \"\"That made you feel jealous, though, really? \"\"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything\ffeels stronger because it's fresh. \"\"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hearthat Rosalie — Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie — wasmeant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that? \"\"There's no competition. \" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped handsaround his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could,even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That'sthe problem. \"\"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like asister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never haveone tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me. \" He wasserious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among mykind, and yours… all the time thinking I was complete in myself, notrealizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because youweren't alive yet. \"\"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest,listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Whyshould I get off so easily? \"\"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder foryou, definitely. \" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only togather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly,from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your lifeevery second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have toturn your back on nature, on humanity… what's that worth? \"\"Very little — I don't feel deprived of anything. \"\"Not yet. \" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wristsin an unbreakable hold. \"What —\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but hesuddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided fallingon my face. \"Lie down!"

He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now? \" I pressed. \"This afternoon…\"\"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still… undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so. \"\"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you. \" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"Iwasn't sure if I was strong enough…\" He picked up one of my hands andpressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still thatpossibility that I might be… overcome\" — he breathed in the scent at mywrist — \"I was… susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strongenough, that there was no possibility at all that I would… that I evercould…\"I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so… human. \"So there's no possibility now? \"\"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in thedarkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but stillexuberantly. \"Easy for you! \" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be… toomuch, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave. \"\fI scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent ofyou in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'maway from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Notquite from scratch, though, I think. \"\"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in myvoice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles — I'm your prisoner. \" But his long hands formedmanacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musicallaugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'dspent with him. \"You seem more… optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen youlike this before. \"\"Isn't it supposed to be like this? \" He smiled. \"The glory of first love,and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between readingabout something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it? \"\"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined. \"\"For example\" — his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate tocatch it all — \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundredthousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays andmovies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shockedme…\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to thedance? \"I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The dayyou started talking to me again. \"\"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt — Ididn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated thanusual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew Ihad no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in thedarkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, towatch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching theannoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, whilewatching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral,ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as Ishould, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that somedayyou would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. Youspoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled overrestlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling thatcoursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn'tignore you any longer. \" He was silent for a moment, probably listening tothe suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy… it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I wouldhave thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about thatvile Mike Newton…\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course. \"\"That made you feel jealous, though, really? \"\"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything\ffeels stronger because it's fresh. \"\"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hearthat Rosalie — Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie — wasmeant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that? \"\"There's no competition. \" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped handsaround his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could,even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That'sthe problem. \"\"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like asister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never haveone tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me. \" He wasserious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among mykind, and yours… all the time thinking I was complete in myself, notrealizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because youweren't alive yet. \"\"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest,listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Whyshould I get off so easily? \"\"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder foryou, definitely. \" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only togather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly,from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your lifeevery second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have toturn your back on nature, on humanity… what's that worth? \"\"Very little — I don't feel deprived of anything. \"\"Not yet. \" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wristsin an unbreakable hold. \"What —\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but hesuddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided fallingon my face. \"Lie down!"

                "text": "Edward stared at Jasper, raising oneeyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do. \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shakemy hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper. \" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's\fnice to meet you all — you have a very beautiful home,\" I addedconventionally. \"Thank you,\" Esme said. \"We're so glad that you came. \" She spoke withfeeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and Iremembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the othersdidn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he wasgazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of thecorner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to thebeautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly rememberedmy childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy agrand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good — she only played forherself on our secondhand upright — but I loved to watch her play. Shewas happy, absorbed — she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then,someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put methrough lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let mequit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play? \" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours? \"\"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical? \"\"No. \" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"Ishould have known, I guess. \"Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right? \" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off— it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\" he laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and theyshared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemedalmost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\" Esme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\" he objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then. \" Esme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled mealong, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room wasfilled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible tobelieve only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth openin astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without abreak, and winked. \"Do you like it? \"\"You wrote this? \" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite. \"I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong? \"\"I'm feeling extremely insignificant. \"The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surpriseI detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion ofnotes. \"You inspired this one,\" he said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\" he said conversationally. \"Esme especially. \"I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go? \"\"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose. \"I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett…\" I trailed off, not surehow to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\" he said, his eyes wide andpersuasive. \"She'll come around. \"I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett? \"\"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problemwith you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie. \"\"What is it that upsets her? \" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know theanswer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with… with what we are. It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. Andshe's a little jealous. \"\"Rosalie is jealous of me? \" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine auniverse in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have anypossible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human. \" He shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too. \"\"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though…\"\"That's really my fault,\" he said. \"I told you he was the most recent totry our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance. \"I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle… ? \" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had athird eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me,afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that Iwas too young when Carlisle changed me… She's ecstatic. Every time Itouch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction. \"\"Alice seems very… enthusiastic. \"\"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\" he said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you? \"A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that Iknew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going togive anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before? \"His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you? \"I shrugged. \"Of course. \"He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"Hewanted to tell me some news — he didn't know if it was something I wouldshare with you. \"\"Will you? \"\"I have to, because I'm going to be a little… overbearingly protectiveover the next few days — or weeks — and I wouldn't want you to think I'mnaturally a tyrant. \"\"What's wrong? \"\"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious. \"\"Visitors? \"\"Yes… well, they aren't like us, of course — in their hunting habits, Imean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly notgoing to let you out of my sight till they're gone. \"I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response! \" he murmured. \"I was beginning to thinkyou had no sense of self-preservation at all. \"I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around thespacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it? \" he asked, his voicesmug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we havecobwebs… what a disappointment this must be for you,\" he continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light… so open. \"He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never haveto hide. \"The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the finalchords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hoveredpoignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbedat them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted hisfinger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly Icouldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouthto taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment beforehe finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house? \"\"No coffins? \" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely maskingthe slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\" he promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along thesatin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneledwith a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room… Carlisle's office… Alice's room…\" He gesturedas he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall,staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\" he said. \"It is sort of ironic. \"I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as ifto touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with thelighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if theaged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less. \"I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here? \" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father. \"\"He collected antiques? \" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in thevicarage where he preached. \"I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing atthe simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math;the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silencestretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so manyyears. \"Are you all right? \" He sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle? \" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, stillstaring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\" Edwardsaid. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Timewasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It wasjust before Cromwell's rule, though. \"I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It waseasier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birthto him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came intopower, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics andother religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves… and vampires. \" I grew very still atthe word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people — of course the real creatures thathe sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of theraids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick toaccuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent,and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of truevampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by\fnight to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths andlegends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" — his brieflaugh was darker now — \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monstersexit into the street. Eventually one emerged. \"His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him callout in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ranthrough the streets, and Carlisle — he was twenty-three and very fast —was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrunthem, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and heturned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third,leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street. \"He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something fromme. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned —anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle actedinstinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley whilethe mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buriedhimself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able tokeep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become. \"I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling? \" he asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, hemust have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me. \"\"A few. \"His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down thehall, pulling me along by the hand."

Hepaused outside the door for an instant. \"Come in,\" Carlisle's voice invited. Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facingwindows. The walls were paneled again, in a darker wood — where they werevisible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves thatreached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outsidea library. Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was justplacing a bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room washow I'd always imagined a college dean's would look — only Carlislelooked too young to fit the part. \"What can I do for you? \" he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat. \"I wanted to show Bella some of our history,\" Edward said. \"Well, yourhistory, actually. \"\"We didn't mean to disturb you,\" I apologized. \"Not at all. Where are you going to start? \"\"The Waggoner,\" Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulderand spinning me around to look back toward the door we'd just comethrough. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my hearthad an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead ofbookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes,some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for somelogic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I foundnothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of asmall square oil painting in a plain wooden frame. This one did not standout among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones ofsepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, withthin spires atop a few scattered towers. A wide river filled theforeground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked liketiny cathedrals. \"London in the sixteen-fifties,\" Edward said. \"The London of my youth,\" Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. Iflinched; I hadn't heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand. \"Will you tell the story? \" Edward asked. I twisted a little to seeCarlisle's reaction. He met my glance and smiled. \"I would,\" he replied. \"But I'm actuallyrunning a bit late. The hospital called this morning — Dr. Snow is takinga sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,\" he added,grinning at Edward now. It was a strange combination to absorb — the everyday concerns of thetown doctor stuck in the middle of a discussion of his early days inseventeenth-century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment. \"What happened then? \" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who waswatching me. \"When he realized what had happened to him? \"He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caughthis interest now. It was a larger landscape in dull fall colors — anempty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the distance. \"When he knew what he had become,\" Edward said quietly, \"he rebelledagainst it. He tried to destroy himself. But that's not easily done. \"\"How? \" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. \"He jumped from great heights,\" Edward told me, his voice impassive. \"Hetried to drown himself in the ocean… but he was young to the new life,and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist… feeding… whilehe was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes overeverything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength totry to kill himself with starvation. \"\"Is that possible? \" My voice was faint. \"No, there are very few ways we can be killed. \"\fI opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. \"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as hecould from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower wasweakening, too. For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliestplaces, loathing himself. \"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild withthirst that he attacked without a thought. His strength returned and herealized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his newphilosophy was born. He could exist without being a demon. He foundhimself again. \"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent,eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied bynight, planned by day. He swam to France and —\"\"He swam to France? \"\"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,\" he reminded me patiently. \"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on. \"\"Swimming is easy for us —\"\"Everything is easy for you,\" I griped. He waited, his expression amused. \"I won't interrupt again, I promise. \"He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. \"Because, technically, wedon't need to breathe. \"\"You —\"\"No, no, you promised. \" He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to mylips. \"Do you want to hear the story or not? \"\"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not tosay anything,\" I mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of myheart reacted to that, but I persisted. \"You don't have to breathe? \" I demanded. \"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit. \" He shrugged. \"How long can you go… without breathing? \"\"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable —being without a sense of smell. \"\"A bit uncomfortable,\" I echoed. I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it madehim grow somber. His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still,his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features wereimmobile as stone. \"What is it? \" I whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. \"I keep waiting for it tohappen. \"\"For what to happen? \"\"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see isgoing to be too much. And then you'll run away from me, screaming as yougo. \" He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. \"I won't stop\fyou. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, Iwant to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile…\" Hetrailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. \"I'm not running anywhere,\" I promised. \"We'll see,\" he said, smiling again. I frowned at him. \"So, go on — Carlisle was swimming to France. \"He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickeredto another picture — the most colorful of them all, the most ornatelyframed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung nextto. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhingaround long pillars and off marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if itrepresented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the cloudsabove were meant to be biblical. \"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to theuniversities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine — andfound his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives. \" Hisexpression became awed, almost reverent. \"I can't adequately describe thestruggle; it took Carlisle two centuries of torturous effort to perfecthis self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human blood,and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a greatdeal of peace there, at the hospital…\" Edward stared off into space for along moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped hisfinger against the huge painting in front of us. \"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They weremuch more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers. \"He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on thehighest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. I examinedthe grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, that Irecognized the golden-haired man. \"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often paintedthem as gods,\" Edward chuckled. \"Aro, Marcus, Caius,\" he said, indicatingthe other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. \"Nighttime patrons ofthe arts. \"\"What happened to them? \" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering acentimeter from the figures on the canvas. \"They're still there. \" He shrugged. \"As they have been for who knows howmany millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for a short time, just afew decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, butthey persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural foodsource,' as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried topersuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try theNew World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely,you see. \"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuffof fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as ifhe were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionshiphe craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. \"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital inChicago. He'd been turning over an idea in his mind for several years,and he had almost decided to act — since he couldn't find a companion, hewould create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformationhad occurred, so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's lifethe way his had been stolen. It was in that frame of mind that he foundme. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He hadnursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try…\"His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeinglythrough the west windows. I wondered which images filled his mind now,Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. \"And so we've come full circle,\" he concluded. \"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then? \" I wondered. \"Almost always. \" He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me withhim as he walked through the door. I stared back at the wall of pictures,wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked,\"Almost? \"He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. \"Well, I had a typical bout ofrebellious adolescence — about ten years after I was… born… created,whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of abstinence,and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for atime. \"\"Really? \" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps shouldhave been. He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flightof stairs, but I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings. \"That doesn't repulse you? \"\"No. \"\"Why not? \"\"I guess… it sounds reasonable. \"He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of thestairs now, in another paneled hallway. \"From the time of my new birth,\" he murmured, \"I had the advantage ofknowing what everyone around me was thinking, both human and non-humanalike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle — I could readhis perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. \"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to hisvision. I thought I would be exempt from the… depression… thataccompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I couldpass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murdererdown a dark alley where he stalked a young girl — if I saved her, thensurely I wasn't so terrible. \"I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described — the alley atnight, the frightened girl, the dark man behind her. And Edward, Edwardas he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. Wouldshe have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? \"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn'tescape the debt of so much human life taken, no matter how justified. AndI went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me back like theprodigal. It was more than I deserved. \"We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall."

                "text": "\"I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and therewas nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car. \" Jacob's complaining voicereached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained withthe rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around toface his son. \"I guess I left it at home. \"Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great. \"\"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" — Billy paused before continuing — \"that westopped by, I mean. \"\"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already? \"\"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself pastJacob. \"Oh. \" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then,\fBella. \"\"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftlytoward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their caras it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for theirritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded abit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed becameinsignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward'sinfluence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave upquickly on choosing an outfit — throwing on an old flannel shirt andjeans — knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only onevoice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But Iknew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize inmy room. \"Hello? \" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess. \" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How wasthe dance? \"\"It was so much fun! \" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation thanthat, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school — they all seemed strangelyirrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying tojudge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella? \" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what? \"\"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it? \"\"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday? \" Jessica challenged, still soundingbothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn'tasked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun. \"I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen? \"The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under thestairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um. \" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo! \" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I wavedat him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind — we'll talktomorrow. See you in Trig. \"\"See ya, Jess. \" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's thefish? \"\"I put it out in the freezer. \"\"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze — Billy dropped off some ofHarry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon. \" I worked to soundenthusiastic. \"He did? \" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite. \"Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till wewere sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying hisfood. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment,struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today? \" he asked, snapping me out of myreverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house…\" Only the veryrecent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat,but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'. \"Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place? \" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah. \"\"What were you doing there? \" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted tointroduce me to his parents… Dad? \"It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right? \"\"You are going out with Edward Cullen? \" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens. \"\"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than hedreamed. \"Wait…\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin? \"\"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair. \" Thebeautiful one, the godlike one…\"Oh, well, that's\" — he struggled — \"better, I guess. I don't like thelook of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too…mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend? \"\"It's Edward, Dad. \"\"Is he? \"\"Sort of, I guess. \"\"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys intown. \" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad. \"He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know. Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay? \"\f\"When is he coming over? \"\"He'll be here in a few minutes. \"\"Where is he taking you? \"I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out ofyour system now. We're going to play baseball with his family. \"His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playingbaseball? \"\"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time. \"\"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped upand started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much. \"The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half astep behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in thehalo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisementfor raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward. \"I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket. \"\"Thanks, sir. \"\"Have a seat there, Edward. \"I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next toChief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behindCharlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball. \" Only in Washingtonwould the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on theplaying of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan. \" He didn't look surprised that I'd told myfather the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess. \"Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay. \" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go. \" I walked backto the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell. \"\"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right? \"I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir. \"\fCharlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over theheadlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to thecrash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged thedistance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and thenlifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I triedto put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this? \" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness. \"\"Uh-oh. \"I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but itwasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. Iwas glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck,brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused onnot hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away fromthe house. \"This is a… um… big Jeep you have. \"\"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way. \"\"Where do you keep this thing? \"\"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage. \"\"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt? \"He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way? \" Myvoice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run. \"\"I'm going to be sick. \"\"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine. \"I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked athim, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way? \" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both. \"I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but hesomehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain\fpath. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I wasbouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoythe ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls onthree sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing everysecond, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here. \"\"You know what? I'll just wait here. \"\"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning. \"\"I haven't forgotten the last time yet. \" Could it have been onlyyesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm…\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have totamper with your memory. \"Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on theground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory? \" I asked nervously. \"Something like that. \" He was watching me intently, carefully, but therewas humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep oneither side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press backagainst the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. Ihad no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes,\"what exactly are you worrying about? \"\"Well, um, hitting a tree —\" I gulped \"— and dying. And then gettingsick. \"He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his coldlips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now? \" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes. \" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick. \"His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now? \" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness. \"He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think Iwould hit a tree, do you? \"\"No, but I might."

                "text": "\"No, not at all — I suppose most dance studios would look the same — themirrors, the bar. \" I traced my finger along the ballet bar set againstthe mirrors. \"It's just the shape that looked familiar. \" I touched thedoor, set in exactly the same place as the one I remembered. \"Would you have any reason to go there now? \" Alice asked, breaking myreverie. \"No, I haven't been there in almost ten years. I was a terrible dancer —they always put me in the back for recitals,\" I admitted. \"So there's no way it could be connected with you? \" Alice asked intently. \"No, I don't even think the same person owns it. I'm sure it's justanother dance studio, somewhere. \"\"Where was the studio you went to? \" Jasper asked in a casual voice. \"It was just around the corner from my mom's house. I used to walk thereafter school…\" I said, my voice trailing off. I didn't miss the look theyexchanged. \"Here in Phoenix, then? \" His voice was still casual. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Fifty-eighth Street and Cactus. \"We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing. \"Alice, is that phone safe? \"\"Yes,\" she reassured me. \"The number would just trace back to Washington. \"\"Then I can use it to call my mom. \"\"I thought she was in Florida. \"\"She is — but she's coming home soon, and she can't come back to thathouse while…\" My voice trembled. I was thinking about something Edwardhad said, about the red-haired female at Charlie's house, at the school,where my records would be. \"How will you reach her? \"\"They don't have a permanent number except at the house — she's supposedto check her messages regularly. \"\"Jasper? \" Alice asked. He thought about it. \"I don't think there's any way it could hurt — besure you don't say where you are, of course. \"I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rangfour times, and then I heard my mom's breezy voice telling me to leave amessage. \"Mom,\" I said after the beep, \"it's me. Listen, I need you to dosomething. It's important. As soon as you get this message, call me atthis number. \" Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me onthe bottom of her picture. I read it carefully, twice. \"Please don't goanywhere until you talk to me. Don't worry, I'm okay, but I have to talkto you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? Ilove you, Mom. Bye. \" I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might thatno unforeseen change of plans would bring her home before she got mymessage. I settled into the sofa, nibbling on a plate of leftover fruit,\fanticipating a long evening. I thought about calling Charlie, but Iwasn't sure if I should be home by now or not. I concentrated on thenews, watching out for stories about Florida, or about spring training —strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks — anything that might sendthem home early. Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemedto feel the need to do anything at all. For a while, Alice sketched thevague outline of the dark room from her vision, as much as she could seein the light from the TV. But when she was done, she simply sat, lookingat the blank walls with her timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have nourge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run screaming out thedoor, the way I did. I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ringagain. The touch of Alice's cold hands woke me briefly as she carried meto the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the pillow. Chapter 21 Phone Call\n    I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was gettingthe schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed andlistened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. Thatthey were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till myfeet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice andJasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again whileJasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, tooengrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more? \" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it'slight now. \"I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its lowceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date. The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a largewindow against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall ledto the living room. One side of that entrance was stone — a large tanstone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room fromthis perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand,were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curvedaround in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house. \"Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at theprecise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically,Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, andthe physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. Thepanic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzingimpossible to decipher. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are goingto take you somewhere, to hide you for a while. \"\"Edward is coming? \" The words were like a life vest, holding my headabove the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him atthe airport, and you'll leave with him. \"\"But, my mother… he came here for my mother, Alice! \" Despite Jasper, thehysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe. \"\"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't yousee what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone,he'll hurt someone I love… Alice, I can't —\"\"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Doyou think it's only my human family he can hurt me with? \"Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washedover me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggledagainst the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open andstood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could befree to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. Forthree and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out ofthis nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only onepossible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how manyother people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would seeEdward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also beable to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of mybehavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would knowhow grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention wasthat, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at theclock — it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land atnine-forty-five. \" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he washere. \"Where's Jasper? \"\"He went to check out. \"\"You aren't staying here? \"\"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house. \"My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I wasalready walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello? \" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here. \" She held the phone out tome. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello? \"\f\"Bella? Bella? \" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had hearda thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to theedge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. Itwas the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message asunalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly awayfrom Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes onme. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explaineverything, I promise. \"I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom? \"\"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to. \" The voice Iheard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenorvoice, a very pleasant, generic voice — the kind of voice that you heardin the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say,and she'll be fine. \" He paused for a minute while I listened in mutehorror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, anddo try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are. '\"\"No, Mom, stay where you are. \" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult. \" The voice was amused, stilllight and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so yourface doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother tosuffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me. ' Say itnow. \"\"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to thebedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behindme, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"But they can still hear you, I'm sure. \"\"Yes. \"\"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me. '\"\"Mom, trust me. \"\"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait,but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn'tit? Less suspense, less anxiety for you. \"I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to getaway from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"No. \"\"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creativethan that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother'slife depended on it? Answer yes or no. \"Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to theairport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out…\"Yes. \"\"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest\fhint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for yourmother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us bynow to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyonealong with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your motherif that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go toyour mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it,and I'll tell you where to go from there. \" I already knew where I wouldgo, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructionsexactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil? \" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please. \"I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious whenyou go back to them. Tell them that your mother called, and that youtalked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me,'Thank you, Mom. ' Say it now. \"\"Thank you, Mom. \" The tears were coming."

She looked surprised, but I wasalready walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello? \" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here. \" She held the phone out tome. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello? \"\f\"Bella? Bella? \" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had hearda thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to theedge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. Itwas the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message asunalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly awayfrom Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes onme. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explaineverything, I promise. \"I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom? \"\"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to. \" The voice Iheard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenorvoice, a very pleasant, generic voice — the kind of voice that you heardin the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say,and she'll be fine. \" He paused for a minute while I listened in mutehorror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, anddo try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are. '\"\"No, Mom, stay where you are. \" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult. \" The voice was amused, stilllight and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so yourface doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother tosuffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me. ' Say itnow. \"\"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to thebedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behindme, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"But they can still hear you, I'm sure. \"\"Yes. \"\"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me. '\"\"Mom, trust me. \"\"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait,but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn'tit? Less suspense, less anxiety for you. \"I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to getaway from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"No. \"\"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creativethan that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother'slife depended on it? Answer yes or no. \"Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to theairport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out…\"Yes. \"\"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest\fhint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for yourmother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us bynow to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyonealong with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your motherif that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go toyour mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it,and I'll tell you where to go from there. \" I already knew where I wouldgo, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructionsexactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no. \"\"Yes. \"\"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil? \" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please. \"I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious whenyou go back to them. Tell them that your mother called, and that youtalked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me,'Thank you, Mom. ' Say it now. \"\"Thank you, Mom. \" The tears were coming."

                "text": "He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward theschool. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in thegym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for adance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches\fand twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table — he wascarrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feetforward — \"there are more than enough vampires present. \"I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of thefloor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed tothe sides of the room to give them space — no one wanted to stand incontrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating andflawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dresswith geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy whiteskin. And Rosalie was… well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vividscarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into awide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitiedevery girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspectingtownsfolk? \" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme? \" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course. \"He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing. \"\"Anything. \"He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringedagainst his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly —if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watchedin horror. \"Edward. \" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestlycan't dance! \" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can. \" He put my arms aroundhis neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes ofeffortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, sothat my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement — I smiledback. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself… alittle. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it? \" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by thespinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black,not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hairsmoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad forJacob. He was clearly uncomfortable — excruciatingly so. His face wasapologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave! \" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you. \"Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident onhis face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here. \" Jacob sounded like he'dbeen hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever. \"Hi, Jacob. \" I smiled back. \"What's up? \"\"Can I cut in? \" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the firsttime. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He musthave grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was toset me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on hisshoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now? \"He was smug. \"Six-two. \"We weren't really dancing — my leg made that impossible. Instead weswayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was justas well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly anduncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight? \" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom? \" headmitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, atleast. Seen anything you like? \" I teased, nodding toward a group of girlslined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken. \"He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second — then we bothlooked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here? \" I asked quickly,though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away,uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. Iswear the old man is losing his mind. \"I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me thatmaster cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished. \" I grinned back. Atleast Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a biteasier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own faceexpressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timidspeculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay? \"\f\"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't evenbe mad at Billy. Just say what you have to. \"\"Well — this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella — he wants you to break upwith your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please. '\" He shook his headin disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh? \"\"Yeah. He was… kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. Hedidn't believe…\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell. \"\"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt. \" It wasn't aquestion, and despite my promise, I was angry. Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to themusic, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so youknow\" — he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in myvoice — \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and hisfather, I'd be dead. \"\"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affectedhim some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At anyrate, you get your parts, right? \"\"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward… upset. \"There's more? \" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself. \"I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob. \"\"It's so bad. \"\"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay… but, geez, this sounds bad. \" He shook his head. \"He said to tellyou, no, to warn you, that — and this is his plural, not mine\" — helifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air— '\"We'll be watching. '\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much. \" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraisingas they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said tobutt the hell out? \" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well. \"The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do youwant to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere? \"Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here. \"Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around,Bella. \" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later. \"\"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a littleup-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leanedmy head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better? \" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me forCharlie's sake. It's nothing personal. \"\"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son isirritating me. \"I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why? \"\"First of all, he made me break my promise. \"I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" heexplained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you. \"\"Thanks. But there's something else. \" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're muchmore than beautiful. \"I laughed. \"You might be a little biased. \"\"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight. \"We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this? \" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepepaper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning methrough the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse ofJessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and Ismiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy inthe arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a headlower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, withConner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we wereoutdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried meacross the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow ofthe madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his faceglowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point? \" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfectthe day is, it always has to end. \"\f\"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantlytense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering myquestion, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want mypresence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you tobe human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died innineteen-eighteen like I should have. \"I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In whatstrange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own freewill? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would neverhave let you get away with this. \"He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, yousaid so yourself. \"\"That's because I was with you. \"We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. Iwished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in anormal human life. \"Will you tell me something? \" he asked, glancing down at me with a slightsmile. \"Don't I always? \"\"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine."

There were actual balloon arches\fand twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table — he wascarrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feetforward — \"there are more than enough vampires present. \"I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of thefloor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed tothe sides of the room to give them space — no one wanted to stand incontrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating andflawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dresswith geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy whiteskin. And Rosalie was… well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vividscarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into awide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitiedevery girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspectingtownsfolk? \" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme? \" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course. \"He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing. \"\"Anything. \"He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringedagainst his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly —if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watchedin horror. \"Edward. \" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestlycan't dance! \" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can. \" He put my arms aroundhis neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes ofeffortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, sothat my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement — I smiledback. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself… alittle. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it? \" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by thespinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black,not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hairsmoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad forJacob. He was clearly uncomfortable — excruciatingly so. His face wasapologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave! \" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you. \"Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident onhis face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here. \" Jacob sounded like he'dbeen hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever. \"Hi, Jacob. \" I smiled back. \"What's up? \"\"Can I cut in? \" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the firsttime. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He musthave grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was toset me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on hisshoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now? \"He was smug. \"Six-two. \"We weren't really dancing — my leg made that impossible. Instead weswayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was justas well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly anduncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight? \" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom? \" headmitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, atleast. Seen anything you like? \" I teased, nodding toward a group of girlslined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken. \"He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second — then we bothlooked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here? \" I asked quickly,though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away,uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. Iswear the old man is losing his mind. \"I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me thatmaster cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished. \" I grinned back. Atleast Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a biteasier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own faceexpressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timidspeculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay? \"\f\"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't evenbe mad at Billy. Just say what you have to. \"\"Well — this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella — he wants you to break upwith your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please. '\" He shook his headin disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh? \"\"Yeah. He was… kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. Hedidn't believe…\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell. \"\"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt. \" It wasn't aquestion, and despite my promise, I was angry. Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to themusic, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so youknow\" — he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in myvoice — \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and hisfather, I'd be dead. \"\"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affectedhim some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At anyrate, you get your parts, right? \"\"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward… upset. \"There's more? \" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself. \"I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob. \"\"It's so bad. \"\"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay… but, geez, this sounds bad. \" He shook his head. \"He said to tellyou, no, to warn you, that — and this is his plural, not mine\" — helifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air— '\"We'll be watching. '\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much. \" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraisingas they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said tobutt the hell out? \" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well. \"The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do youwant to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere? \"Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here. \"Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around,Bella. \" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later. \"\"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a littleup-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leanedmy head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better? \" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me forCharlie's sake. It's nothing personal. \"\"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son isirritating me. \"I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why? \"\"First of all, he made me break my promise. \"I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" heexplained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you. \"\"Thanks. But there's something else. \" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're muchmore than beautiful. \"I laughed. \"You might be a little biased. \"\"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight. \"We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this? \" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepepaper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning methrough the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse ofJessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and Ismiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy inthe arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a headlower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, withConner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we wereoutdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried meacross the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow ofthe madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his faceglowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point? \" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfectthe day is, it always has to end. \"\f\"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantlytense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering myquestion, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want mypresence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you tobe human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died innineteen-eighteen like I should have. \"I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In whatstrange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own freewill? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would neverhave let you get away with this. \"He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, yousaid so yourself. \"\"That's because I was with you. \"We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. Iwished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in anormal human life. \"Will you tell me something? \" he asked, glancing down at me with a slightsmile. \"Don't I always? \"\"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine."
