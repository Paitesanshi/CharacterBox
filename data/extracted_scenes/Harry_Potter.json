Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. txt\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\nCHAPTER ONE\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something. . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking. . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that. . . but all the same, those people in cloaks. . . He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day! \"\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \"Shoo! \" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't! \"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern. \" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim? \"\n\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight. \"\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters. . . Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you? \"\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why? \"\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls. . . shooting stars. . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today. . . \"\n\"So? \" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \"Well, I just thought. . . maybe. . . it was something to do with. . . you know. . . her crowd. \"\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter. \" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he? \"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it? \"\n\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me. \"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree. \"\nHe didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did. . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them. . . . How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots."

                "text": "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid? \"\n\"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle. \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --? \"\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter. . . what an honor. \"\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back. \"\nHarry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last. \"\n\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud. \"\n\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter. \"\n\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle. \"\n\"I've seen you before! \" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop. \"\n\"He remembers! \" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me! \" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \"Professor Quirrell! \" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts. \"\n\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you. \"\n\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell? \"\n\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter? \" He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself. \" He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry. \"\nDoris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. \"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'. \"\n\"Is he always that nervous? \"\n\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\nstudyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella? \"\nVampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \"Three up. . . two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry. \"\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley. \"\nHe grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first. \"\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad. . . . \"\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . . \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -\n\"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\nMust pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors\nA treasure that was never yours,\nThief, you have been warned, beware\nOf finding more than treasure there. \"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe. \"\n\"You have his key, Sir? \"\n\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. \"That seems to be in order. \"\n\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen. \"\nThe goblin read the letter carefully. \"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook! \"\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen? \" Harry asked. \"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that. \"\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering. Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite? \"\n\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick. \"\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid. All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh. \" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly? \"\n\"One speed only,\" said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook. \"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside? \" Harry asked. \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had."

                "text": "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. \"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity. \"\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. \"\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. \"Potter! \" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? \"\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. \"I don't know, sit,\" said Harry. Snape's lips curled into a sneer. \"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything. \"\nHe ignored Hermione's hand. \"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar? \"\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \"I don't know, sit. \" \"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter? \" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane? \"\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her? \"\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down? \"\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter. \"\nThings didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \"Idiot boy! \" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire? \"\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor. \"\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty. \"\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you? \"\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back. \"\nHagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang. \"\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \"Another Weasley, eh? \" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest. \"\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old git. \"\n\"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it. \"\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \"But he seemed to really hate me. \"\n\"Rubbish! \" said Hagrid. \"Why should he? \"\nYet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that. \"How's yer brother Charlie? \" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals. \"\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date. \"Hagrid! \" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there! \"\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry? CHAPTER NINE\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy. \"\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk. \"\nMalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \"It's a Remembrall! \" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do."

                "text": "He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section. \"\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them. \"\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom? \" he whispered. \"Dad? \"\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror. \"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone. \"\n\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything? \"\nHarry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right? \" said Ron. \"You look odd. \"\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \"I'm freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let's forget it and go back. \"\n\"No! \" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere. \"\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \"It's here -- just here -- yes! \"\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \"See? \" Harry whispered. \"I can't see anything. \"\n\"Look! Look at them all. . . there are loads of them. . . . \"\n\"I can only see you. \"\n\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am. \"\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \"Look at me! \" he said. \"Can you see all your family standing around you? \"\n\"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy! \"\n\"What? \"\n\"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too. Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \"Do you think this mirror shows the future? \"\n\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"\n\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time. \"\n\"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents. \"\n\"Don't push me --\"\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking. \"Quick! \"\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on. \"\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn't melted the next morning. \"Want to play chess, Harry? \" said Ron. \"No. \"\n\"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid? \"\n\"No. . . you go. . . \"\n\"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight. \"\n\"Why not? \"\n\"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over? \"\n\"You sound like Hermione. \"\n\"I'm serious, Harry, don't go. \"\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except --\n\"So -- back again, Harry? \"\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. \" -- I didn't see you, sir. \"\n\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. \"\n\"I didn't know it was called that, Sir. \"\n\"But I expect you've realized by now what it does? \"\n\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy. \"\n\"How did you know --? \"\n\"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all? \"\nHarry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help? \"\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want. . . whatever we want. . . \"\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."

                "text": "\"What've you done to him? \" Harry whispered. \"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry. \"\n\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. \"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything. They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \"Who's there? \" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie? \"\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen. \"\nHarry had a sudden idea. \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible. \"\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir. \"\n\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight. \"\n\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you. \"\nAnd he scooted off\n\"Brilliant, Harry! \" whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar. \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy. \"\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now. \"\n\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron. \"We're coming,\" said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them. \"What's that at its feet? \" Hermione whispered. \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there. \"\n\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes. . . \"\nHe put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione? \"\n\"No, I don't! \"\n\"All right. \" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \"What can you see? \" Hermione said anxiously. \"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop. \"\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \"You want to go first? Are you sure? \" said Ron. \"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep. \"\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right? \"\n\"Right,\" said Ron. \"See you in a minute, I hope. . . And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \"It's okay! \" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump! \"\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \"What's this stuff? \" were his first words. \"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione! \"\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side. \"We must be miles under the school , she said. \"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron. \"Lucky! \" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both! \"\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \"Stop moving! \" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare! \"\n\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it! \" said Hermione. \"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe! \" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. . . what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp\n\"So light a fire! \" Harry choked. \"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood! \" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD? \" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT? \"\n\"Oh, right! \" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly. \"\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough. . . \"Can you hear something? \" Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \"Do you think it's a ghost? \"\n\"I don't know. . . sounds like wings to me. \"\n\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving. \"\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room? \" said Ron. \"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once. . . well, there's no other choice. . . I'll run. \"\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. \"Now what? \" said Ron. \"These birds. . . they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? \"They're not birds! \" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean. . . \" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \". . . yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door! \"\n\"But there are hundreds of them! \"\nRon examined the lock on the door. \"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle. \"\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \"That one! \" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side. \"\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \"We've got to close in on it! \" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW! \"\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \"Ready? \" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces. \"Now what do we do? \" Harry whispered. \"It's obvious, isn't it? \" said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the room. \"\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How? \" said Hermione nervously. \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen. \"\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron."

No note! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my\nmind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I've lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -\"\n\"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred. \"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S BOOK! \" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred's chest. \"You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job -\"\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away. \"I'm very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and have some breakfast. \"\nShe turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her. The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a\nscrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before. The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck. \"\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don't know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it. \"\n\"I don't blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you -\"\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background. \"It was cloudy, Mum! \" said Fred. \"You keep your mouth closed while you're eating! \" Mrs. Weasley snapped. \"They were starving him, Mum! \" said George. \"And you! \" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him. At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. \"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She's been talking about you all summer. \"\n\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. \"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \"I think I'll go to bed and -\"\n\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're getting completely out of hand again -\"\n\"Oh, Mum -\"\n\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to bed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn't ask them to fly that wretched car -\"\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've never seen a de-gnoming -\"\n\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\"\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned. \"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\"\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it's a wonderful book . . . . \"\n\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it. \"\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. \"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron\nthey crossed the lawn. \"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods . . . . \"\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly. \"Gerroff me! Gerroff me! \" squealed the gnome. It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. \"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me! \") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find their way back to the gnomeholes. \"\nHe let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. \"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump. \"\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until\n\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet . . . . . . The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay put. \"\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. \"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here . . . . Dad's too soft with them; he thinks they're funny . . . . \"\nJust then, the front door slammed. \"He's back! \" said George. \"Dad's home! \"\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the house. Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned . . . . . . Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. \"Find anything, Dad? \" said Fred eagerly. \"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn't my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that's the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness . . . . . . \"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink? \" said George. \"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it . . . . Of course, it's very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they'll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face . . . . But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn't believe -\"\n\"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE? \"\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley's eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife. \"C-cars, Molly, dear? \"\n\"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly. \"\nMr. Weasley blinked. \"Well, dear, I think you'll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth . . . . There's a loophole in the law, you'll find . . . . As long as he wasn't intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn't -\"\n\"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law! \" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren't intending to fly! \"\n\"Harry? \" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who? \"\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. \"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about -\"\n\"Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night. \"\nshouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh? \"\n\"Did you really? \" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I mean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley's eyes, \"that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed . . . . . . \"Let's leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I'll show you my bedroom. \"\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up\nthrough the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. \"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don't know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally -\"\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD'S ROOM. Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. \"Your Quidditch team? \" said Harry."

                "text": "Nothing to worry about\njust to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in -\"\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now! \"\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart 's favorite color? 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition? 3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date? On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\n4. When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday, and what would his ideal gift be? Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. \"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn't say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky! \"\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name. \". . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger? \"\n*100*\nHermione raised a trembling hand. \"Excellent! \" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business -\"\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it. \"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm. \"\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat. \"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them. \"\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies. \"\nSeamus Finnigan couldn't control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn't mistake for a scream of terror. \"Yes? \" He smiled at Seamus. \"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they? \" Seamus choked. \"Don't be so sure! \" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be! \"\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they\n*101*\nhad started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of them! \" And he opened the cage. It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. \"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies,\" Lockhart shouted. He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\n\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi! \"\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way. The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. \" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him. *102*\n\"Can you believe him? \" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. \"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing -\"\n\"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You've read his books - look at all those amazing things he's done -\"\n\"He says he's done,\" Ron muttered. arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry? \" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier\n*104*\nthan he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \"Whassamatter? \" said Harry groggily. \"Quidditch practice! \" said Wood. \"Come on! \"\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making. \"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn. \"\n\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -\"\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. \"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes. When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand. \"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I've got here! I've had it developed, I wanted to show you -\"\n*105*\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose. A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. \"Will you sign it? \" said Colin eagerly. \"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice -\"\nHe climbed through the portrait hole. \"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I've never watched a Quidditch game before! \"\nColin scrambled through the hole after him. \"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement. \"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't you, Harry? Weren't you? \" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is? \"\nHarry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. \"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters\n*106*\non each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters. \"\n\"And what are the other balls for? \" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. \"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they're three long poles with hoops on the end. \"\n\"And the fourth ball -\"\n\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points. \"\n\"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you? \" said Colin in awe. \"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew- drenched grass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That's it, really. \"\nBut Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry! \" and hurried off to the stands. The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie\n*107*\nBell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. \"There you are, Harry, what kept you? \" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference . . . . Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore. The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions? \"\n\"I've got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake? \"\nWood wasn't pleased. \"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control - \"\n*108*\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat."

                "text": "After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much. As eleven o'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day\n*166*\nwith a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood's usual pre-match pep talk. \"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it. But we've got better people on our brooms. We've trained harder than they have, we've been flying in all weathers -\" (\"Too true,\" muttered George Weasley. \"I haven't been properly dry since August\") \"- and we're going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team. \"\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \"It'll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we've got to win today, we've got to. \"\n\"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him. As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary. \"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three . . . two . . . one. . . With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch. *167*\n\"All right there, Scarhead? \" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom. Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed. \"Close one, Harry! \" said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again. Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry's head. Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible . . . . Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course. \"Gotcha! \" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn't have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero ='\n*168*\nThe Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it. \"Someone's - tampered - with - this - Bludger -\" Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry. \"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry's nose at the same time. Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. \"What's going on? \" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We're being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring? \"\n\"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone's fixed it - it won't leave Harry alone. It hasn't gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it. \"\n\"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch's office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then . . . . \" said Wood, anxiously. Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction. 169\n\"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two flying around me all the time the only way I'm going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one. \"\n\"Don't be thick,\" said Fred. \"It'll take your head off. \"\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. (I Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry -))\n\"If we stop now, we'll have to forfeit the match! \" said Harry. \"And we're not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone! \"\n\"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \" `Get the Snitch or die trying,' what a stupid thing to tell him -\"\nMadam Hooch had joined them. \"Ready to resume play? \" she asked Wood. Wood looked at the determined look on Harry's face. \"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry -leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own. \"\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch's whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn't change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the\n*170*\nedges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood\nA whistling in Harry's ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction. \"Training for the ballet, Potter? \" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy's left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn't seen it. For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch. WHAM. He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time W-ming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy. Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him. \"What the -\" he gasped, careening out of Harry's way. Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only\n*171*\ngripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand. \"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We've won. \"\nAnd he fainted. He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth. \"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned. \"Doesn't know what he's saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry. I'm about to fix your arm. \"\n\"No! \"said Harry. \"I'll keep it like this, thanks . . . . . . He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. \"I don't want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly. \"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It's a simple charm I've used countless times -\"\n\"Why can't I just go to the hospital wing? \" said Harry through clenched teeth. \"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn't help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, Id say -\"\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and\n*112*\nGeorge Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight. \"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves. \"No - don't -\" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry's arm. A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry's shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn't dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn't hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm. \"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That's the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit. \"\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh- colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened. Lockhart hadn't mended Harry's bones. He had removed them. Madam Pomfrey wasn't at all pleased. \"You should have come straight to me! \" she raged, holding up\n*173*\nthe sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - \"\n\"You will be able to, won't you? \" said Harry desperately. \"I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You'll have to stay the night . . . . . . Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry's bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. \"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh? \" Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry's limp fingers through the cuff. \"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked. \"\n\"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn't hurt anymore, does it, Harry?"

                "text": "His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want that lying around, would they? \"\n\"That's a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in his diary. \"\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \"It might be invisible ink! \" she whispered. She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium! \"\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. \"It's a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said. She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \"I'm telling you, there's nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn't be bothered filling it in. \"\nHarry couldn't explain, even to himself, why he didn't just throw Riddle's diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though\n* 233 *\nRiddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and had halfforgotten. But this was absurd. He'd never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle's special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he'd seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. Riddle's burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn't carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle's name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy . . . probably top of every class -\"\n\"You say that like it's a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice. The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. \"The moment their acne clears up, they'll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won't be long until we're cutting them up and stewing them. You'll have Mrs. Norris back in no time. \"\n* 243 *\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years . . . . Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn't take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn't helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter . . . \" now with a dance routine to match. Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. \"I don't think there'll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him. \"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won't say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing . . . . \"\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off. Lockhart's idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn't had much sleep because of a late- running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he'd walked through the wrong doors. The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse\n* 235*\nstill, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles. \"What's going on? \" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon. Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. \"Happy Valentine's Day! \" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here! \"\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. \"My friendly, card-carrying cupids! \" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog! \"\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look\n* 236\ning as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer. All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry. \"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter! \" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces. \"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. \"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape. \"Stay still! \" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back. \"Let me go! \" Harry snarled, tugging. With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. *237*\n\"What's going on here? \" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \"What's all this commotion? \" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor. \"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \"Here is your singing valentine:\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. \"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Malfoy-\"\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary. \"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly. \"Wonder what Potter's written in this? \" said Malfoy, who obvi\n* 238\nously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified. \"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly. \"When I've had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry. Percy said, \"As a school prefect -\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus! \" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. \"Harry! \" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know! \"\nBut Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much! \"\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else. Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time. Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter. \"\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened. Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written. \"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary? \"\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back. \"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet. \"\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle's reply. \"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \"\n\"What do you mean? \" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement. *240*\n`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"\n\"That's where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets? \"\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew. \"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets."

In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \"\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back. \"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time? \"\n\"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle's reply. \"You don't have\nto take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \"\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was\n *241*\ngrowing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming. \"Let me show you. \"\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. (40K. 55\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow. He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before. \"I'm sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn't mean to butt in -\"\nBut the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I'll just go, shall I? \"\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice. *242*\n\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\" he half-shouted. The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window. The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. There was a knock on the office door. \"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice. A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair. \"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster. \"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet? \" said Riddle. He looked nervous. \"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I've just been reading the letter you sent me. \"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly. \"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays? \"\n\"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\"\n* 243*\n\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe? \" said Dippet curiously. \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly. \"You are Muggle-born? \"\n\"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother. \"\n\"And are both your parents -? \"\n\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather. \"\nDipper clucked his tongue sympathetically. \"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . . \"\n\"You mean all these attacks, sir? \" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything. \"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl . . . . You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . . \"\nRiddle's eyes had widened. \"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\"\n\"What do you mean? \" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks? \"\n\"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly. But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore. *244*\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. \"You may go, Tom . . . . . . Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him. Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn't see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. \"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom? \"\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year- younger Dumbledore. \"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . . \"\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. But to Harry's disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn't been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just\n*2 45 *\nsee him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door. Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn't be heard. For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. \"C'mon . . . gotta get yeh outta here . . . . C'mon now . . . in the box. . . \"\nThere was something familiar about that voice . . . . Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. \"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply. The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \"What yer doin' down here, Tom? \"\nRiddle stepped closer. \"It's all over,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop. \"\n4 6\n\"N\" at d'yeh -\"\n\"I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and -\"\n\"It never killed no one! \" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. \"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered . . . . . . \"It wasn't him! \" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn'! He never! \"\n\"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand. His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NO000000! \"\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle's diary lying open on his stomach. *24 7*\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in. \"There you are,\" he said. Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking. \"What's up? \" said Ron, looking at him with concern. \"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. \"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three- headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy. \" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody. Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what\nhe'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed. \"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people . . . . \"\n\"How many monsters d'you think this place can hold? \" Ron asked dully. \"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn't have got his award. \"\nRon tried a different tack. \"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway? \"\n\"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don't blame him for wanting to stay here . . . . . . \"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn't you, Harry?"

                "text": "And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his\n*301\nfeet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. \"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. \"Lumos! \" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away . . . . . . But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat's skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. \"Harry - there's something up there -\" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry's shoulder. They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn't moving. \"Maybe it's asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart's hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt. * 302 *\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly. There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart's knees had given way. \"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron's wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \"The adventure ends here, boys! \" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories! \"\nHe raised Ron's Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate! \"\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \"Ron! \" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron! \"\n\"I'm here! \" came Ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I'm okay - this git's not, though - he got blasted by the wand ='\n*303*\nThere was a dull thud and a loud \"ow! \" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. \"What now? \" Ron's voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can't get through - it'll take ages . . . . . . Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn't seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in? There was another thud and another \"ow! \" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours . . . . Harry knew there was only one thing to do. \"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I'll go on. . . . If I'm not back in an hour. . . There was a very pregnant pause,\n\"I'll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry -\"\n\"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice. And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry's body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he'd find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. *304*\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive. He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \"Open, \"said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. *306*\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. \"tinny! \" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"tinny - don't be dead - please don't be dead -\" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny's shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn't Petrified. But then she must be\n\"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side. \"She won't wake,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him\n\"Tom - Tom Riddle? \"\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry's face. \"What d'you mean, she won't wake? \" Harry said desperately. \"She's not - she's not -? \"\n\"She's still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just. \"\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \"Are you a ghost? \" Harry said uncertainly. * 30 7*\n\"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years. He pointed toward the floor near the statue's giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with. \"You've got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny's head again. \"We've got to get her out of here. There's a basilisk . . . I don't know where it is, but it could be along any moment . . . . Please, help me -1)\nRiddle didn't move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again. But his wand had gone. \"Did you see -? \"\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry's wand between his long fingers. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of Riddle's mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. \"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny's dead weight. \"We've got to go! If the basilisk comes -\"\n\"It won't come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly. Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer. \"What d'you mean? \" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it -\"\nRiddle's smile broadened. \"You won't be needing it,\" he said. *%08*\nHarry stared at him. \"What d'you mean, I won't be -? \"\n\"I've waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you. \"\n\"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don't think you get it. We're in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later -\"\n\"We're going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry's wand. Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here . . . . \"How did Ginny get like this? \" he asked slowly. \"Well, that's an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley's like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger. \"\n\"What are you talking about? \" said Harry. \"The diary,\" said Riddle. `My diary. Little Ginny's been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\" -Riddle's eyes glinted \"how she didn't think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her . . . . \"\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle's eyes never left Harry's face. There was an almost hungry look in them. \"It's very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven- year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one's ever understood me like you, Tom . . . . I'm so glad I've got this diary to\n*309*\nconfide in . . . . It's like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket . . . . Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck. \"If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted . . . . I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her. . . \"\n\"What d'you mean? \" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry. \" Haven't you guessed yet, Harry Potter? \" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib's cat. \"No,\" Harry whispered. \"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn't know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became . . . . Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry's horrified face, `I think I'm losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, l can't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself. I think he suspects me. . ."

And that's where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn't have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet . . . . \"\n\"And why did you want to meet me? \" said Harry.

On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student . . . on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls . . . but I\n* 31:L *\nadmit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked.

But I wasn't going to waste those long years Id spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work. \"\n\"Well, you haven't finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one's died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again -\"\n\"Haven't I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been -you. \"\nHarry stared at him. \"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was\n*312*\nopened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. \"What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery --\nparticularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue . . . . \"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn't much life left in her . . . . She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last . . . . I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter. \"\n\"Like what? \" Harry spat, fists still clenched. \"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? \"\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. \"Why do you care how I escaped? \" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was after your time . . . . . . \"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter . . . . \"\nHe pulled Harry's wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:\nTOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:\nI AM LORD VOLDEMORT\n\"You see? \" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world! \"\nHarry's brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry's own parents, and so many others . . . . At last he forced himself to -,peak. \"You're not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. \"Not what? \" snapped Riddle. \"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn't dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you're hiding these days -\"\nThe smile had gone from Riddle's face, to be replaced by a very ugly look. *31-4*\n\"Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me! \" he hissed. \"He's not as gone as you might think! \" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze. Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry's scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar. A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock's and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle. A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye. The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry's cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle. \"That's a phoenix\tsaid Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it. \"Fawkes? \" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird's golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently\n\"And that -\" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \"that's the old school Sorting Hat -\"\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry's feet. Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once\n\"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now? \"\nHarry didn't answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting. \"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added softly, \"the longer you stay alive. \"\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right . . . but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny . . . and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle's outline was becoming clearer, more solid . . . . If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later. \"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\" said Harry abruptly. \"I don't know myself But I know why you couldn't kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She stopped you killing me. And I've seen the real you, I saw you last year. You're a wreck. You're barely alive. That's where all your power got you. You're in hiding. You're ugly, you're foul -\"\n*%16*\nRiddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful countercharm. I can see now . . . there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike . . . but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's all I wanted to know. \"\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle's twisted smile was widening again. \"Now, Harry, I'm going to teach you a little lesson. Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him . . . . \"\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Ridthe stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying . . . . \"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. \"\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder. Slytherin's gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. And something was stirring inside the statue's mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths. 3 1\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don't leave me! \" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin's mouth. Then he heard Riddle's hissing voice:\n\"Kill him. \"\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall."

                "text": "\"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told me what he did? \"\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. \"He -- didn't work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry. \"Unemployed. \"\n\"As I expected! \" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who --\"\n\"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life. \"MORE BRANDY! \" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go to bed, go on --\"\n\"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry's. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) --\"\n'They didn't die in a car crash! \" said Harry, who found himself on his feet. \"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives! \" screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little --\"\nBut Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her great red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a salami --\n\"MARGE! \" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking madly. \"NOOOOOOO! \"\nUncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg. Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters. \"COME BACK IN HERE! \" he bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT! \"\nBut a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon. \"She deserved it,\" Harry said, breathing very fast. \"She deserved what she got. You keep away from me. \"\nHe fumbled behind him for the latch on the door. \"I'm going,\" Harry said. \"I've had enough. \"\nAnd in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig's cage under his arm. CHAPTER THREE\nTHE KNIGHT BUS\nHarry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart. But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren't swooping down on him where he sat. Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. What, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them. He didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He'd never be able to drag his trunk all the way to London. Unless. . . He looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If he was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn't hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak, and flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and. . . begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he'd find himself trying to explain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick. Harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for the Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up suddenly, looking around him once more. A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights shone from any of the large square houses. He bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else. \"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter --\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light --\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. For a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night. \"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve --\"\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of \"Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large, protruding ears and quite a few pimples. \"What were you doin' down there? \" said Stan, dropping his professional manner. \"Fell over,\" said Harry. \"'Choo fall over for? \" sniggered Stan. \"I didn't do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence. The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was empty. \"'Choo lookin' at? \" said Stan. \"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap. \"Like a dog. . . but massive. . . \"\nHe looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead. \"Woss that on your 'ead? \" said Stan abruptly. \"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the Ministry of Magic was looking for him, he didn't want to make it too easy for them. \"Woss your name? \" Stan persisted. \"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into his head. \"So -- so this bus,\" he went on quickly, hoping to distract Stan, \"did you say it goes anywhere? \"\n\"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't do nuffink underwater. 'Ere,\" he said, looking suspicious again, ,You did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand 'and, dincha? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to London? \"\n\"Eleven Sickles,\" said Stan, \"but for fifteen you get 'or chocolate, and for fifteen you get an 'ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of your choice. \"\nHarry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk, with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus. There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed, illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs\" and rolled over in his sleep. \"You 'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville Longbottom, Ern. \"\nErnie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to Harry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed. \"Take 'er away, Ern,\" said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie's. There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment. \"This is where we was before you flagged us down,\" he said. \"Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales? \"\n\"Ar,\" said Ernie. \"How come the Muggles don't hear the bus? \" said Harry. \"Them! \" said Stan contemptuously. \"Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'. \"\n\"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\" said Ern. \"We'll be in Abergavenny in a minute. \"\nStan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase. Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous. Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed. Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak. \"'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane, trees leaping out of the way."

                "text": "Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge off the ceiling yet. Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He looked strangely familiar. \"That man! \" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on the Muggle news! \"\nStanley turned to the front page and chuckled. \"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"'Course 'e was on the Muggle news, Neville, where you been? \"\nHe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry. \"You oughta read the papers more, Neville. \"\nHarry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\nBLACK STILL AT LARGE\nSirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today. \"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community to remain calm. \"\nFudge has been criticized by some members of the International Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis. \"Well, really, I had to, don't you know,\" said an irritable Fudge. \"Black is mad. He's a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him if he did? \"\nWhile Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse. Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one. \"Scary-lookin' fing, inee? \" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read. \"He murdered thirteen people? \" said Harry, handing the page back to Stan, \"with one curse? \"\n\"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern? \"\n\"Ar,\" said Ern darkly. Stan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look at Harry. \"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-'Oo,\" he said. \"What, Voldemort? \" said Harry, without thinking. Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus. \"You outta your tree? \" yelped Stan. \"'Choo say 'is name for? \"\n\"Sorry,\" said Harry hastily. \"Sorry, I -- I forgot --\"\n\"Forgot! \" said Stan weakly. \"Blimey, my 'eart's goin' that fast . . . \"\n\"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who? \" Harry prompted apologetically. \"Yeah,\" said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \"Yeah, that's right. Very close to You-Know-'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little 'Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-'Oo --\"\nHarry nervously flattened his bangs down again. \"-- all You-Know-'Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern? Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-'Oo gone, and they came quiet. But not Sirius Black. I 'eard he thought 'e'd be second-in-command once You-Know-'Oo 'ad taken over. \"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an' Black took out 'is wand and 'e blasted 'alf the street apart, an' a wizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. 'Orrible, eh? An' you know what Black did then? \" Stan continued in a dramatic whisper. \"What? \" said Harry. \"Laughed,\" said Stan. \"Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv em quiet as anyfink, still laughing 'is 'ead off. 'Cos 'e's mad, inee, Ern? Inee mad? \"\n\"If he weren't when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,\" said Ern in his slow voice. \"I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves him right, mind you . . . after what he did. . . . \"\n\"They 'ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern? \" Stan said. \"'Ole street blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad 'appened, Ern? \"\n\"Gas explosion,\" grunted Ernie. \"An' now 'e's out,\" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black's gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, 'as there, Ern? Beats me 'ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't fancy 'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern? \"\nErnie suddenly shivered. \"Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles. \"\nStan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn't help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights' time. \"'Ear about that 'Arry Potter? Blew up 'is aunt! We 'ad 'im 'ere on the Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? 'E was tryin' I to run for it. . . . \"\nHe, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he'd ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of terror on Hagrid's face when he had been told where he was going, and Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew. The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go. Finally, Harry was the only passenger left. \"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in London? \"\n\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry. \"Righto,\" said Stan. \"'Old tight, then. \"\nBANG. They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he didn't know. Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the magical entrance to Diagon Alley. \"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern. He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig's cage onto the pavement. \"Well,\" said Harry. \"'Bye then! \"\nBut Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron. \"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice. Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come 'ere! Come 'ere I\"\nHarry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them. \"What didja call Neville, Minister? \" he said excitedly. Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and exhausted. \"Neville? \" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter. \"\n\"I knew it! \" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess 'oo Neville is, Ern! 'E's 'Arry Potter! I can see 'is scar! \"\n\"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now. . . \"\nFudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord. \"You've got him, Minister! \" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything? Beer? Brandy? \"\n\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry. There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around excitedly. \"'Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville? \" said Stan, beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over Stan's shoulder. \"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly. `Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar. \"'Bye, Neville! \" called Stan. Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room. \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry. \"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic. \"\nHarry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn't to know that. Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind him. \"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! I'd started to think. . . but you're safe, and that's what matters. \"\nFudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry. \"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then. . . You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done. \"\nFudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again. \"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle? \" said Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays. \"\nHarry unstuck his throat. \"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive. \"\n\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\" said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down. \"\nIt didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now."

                "text": "I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye. \"\nNobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you. . Books can take you only so far in this field. . . . \"\nAt these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this subject. \"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,\" she said suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well? \"\n\"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously. \"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Professor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,\" she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red-haired man. \"\nParvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him. \"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, \"we shall progress to the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever. \"\nA very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it. \"I wonder, dear,\" she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot? \"\nLavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney. \"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October. \"\nLavender trembled. \"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing. Oh, and dear\" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up -- \"after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink. \"\nSure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn't mind. . . thank you. . . . \"\nWhen Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the cups and swapped over. \"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six. \"What can you see in mine? \"\n\"A load of soggy brown stuff,\" said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid. \"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the mundane! \" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom. Harry tried to pull himself together. \"Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross. . . \" He consulted Unfogging the Future. \"That means you're going to have 'trials and suffering' -- sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun. . . hang on. . . that means 'great happiness'. . . so you're going to suffer but be very happy. . . . \"\n\"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction. \"My turn. . . \" Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his forehead wrinkled with effort. \"There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" he said. \"Maybe you're going to work for the Ministry of Magic. . . He turned the teacup the other way up. \"But this way it looks more like an acorn. . . . What's that? \" He scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. \"'A windfall, unexpected gold. ' Excellent, you can lend me some. . . and there's a thin, here,\" he turned the cup again, \"that looks like an animal. . . yeah, if that was its head. . . it looks like a hippo. . . no, a sheep. . . \"\nProfessor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter. \"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry's cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch. Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it counterclockwise. \"The falcon. . . my dear, you have a deadly enemy. \"\n\"But everyone knows that, \" said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor Trelawney stared at her. \"Well, they do,\" said Hermione. \"Everybody knows about Harry and You-Know-Who. \"\nHarry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before. Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to Harry's cup again and continued to turn it. \"The club. . . an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup. . . . I thought that was a bowler hat,\" said Ron sheepishly. \"The skull. . . danger in your path, my dear. . . . \"\nEveryone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed. \"My dear boy. . . my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say. . . no. . . don't ask me. . . . \"\n\"What is it, Professor? \" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a\ngood look at Harry's cup. \"My dear,\" Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,\n\"You have the Grim. \"\n\"The what? \" said Harry. He could tell that he wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror. \"The Grim, my dear, the Grim! \" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked shocked that Harry hadn't understood. \"The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of death! \"\nHarry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent. . . Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair. \"I don't think it looks like a Grim,\" she said flatly. Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike. \"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future. \" Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side. \"It looks like a Grim if you do this,\" he said, with his eyes almost shut, \"but it looks more like a donkey from here,\" he said, leaning to the left. \"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not! \" said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want to look at him. \"I think we will leave the lesson here for today,\" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest voice. \"Yes. . . please pack away your things. . . . \"\nSilently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney, packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry's eyes. \"Until we meet again,\" said Professor Trelawney faintly, \"fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear\" -- she pointed at Neville -- \"you'll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up. \"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time. Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes. \"Really, what has got into you all today? \" said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them all. \"Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class. \"\nEverybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then Hermione raised her hand. \"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and --\"\n\"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. \"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year? \"\nEveryone stared at her. \"Me,\" said Harry, finally. \"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes. \"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues --\"\nProfessor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney --\"\nShe stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in. \"\nHermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced, however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what about Neville's cup? \"\nWhen the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch. \"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \"You heard what Professor McGonagall said. \"\nRon spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn't start. \"Harry,\" he said, in a low, serious voice, \"You haven't seen a great black dog anywhere, have you? \"\n\"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. \"\nRon let his fork fall with a clatter. \"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly. Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad. \"Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad,\" he said. \"My -- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later! \"\n\"Coincidence,\" said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice. \"You don't know what you're talking about! \" said Ron, starting to get angry."

                "text": "\"Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards! \"\n\"There you are, then,\" said Hermione in a superior tone. \"They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death! And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then! \"\nRon mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug. \"I think Divination seems very woolly,\" she said, searching for her page. \"A lot of guesswork, if you ask me. \"\n\"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup! \" said Ron hotly. \"You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep,\" said Hermione coolly. \"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't like being bad at something for a change! \"\nHe had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere. \"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class! \"\nShe snatched up her bag and stalked away. Ron frowned after her. \"What's she talking about? \" he said to Harry. \"She hasn't been to an Arithmancy class yet. \"\nHarry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical Creatures class. Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about. Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking impatient to start. \"C'mon, now, get a move on! \" he called as the class approached. \"Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me! \"\nFor one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock. There was nothing in there. \"Everyone gather 'round the fence here! \" he called. \"That's it -- make sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --\"\n\"How? \" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. \"Eh? \" said Hagrid. \"How do we open our books? \" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips. \"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books? \" said Hagrid, looking crestfallen. The class all shook their heads. \"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em,\" said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world. \"Look --\"\nHe took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand. \"Oh, how silly we've all been! \" Malfoy sneered. \"We should have stroked them! why didn't we guess! \"\n\"I -- I thought they were funny,\" Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione. \"Oh, tremendously funny! \" said Malfoy. \"Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off! \"\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success. \"Righ' then,\" said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \"so -- so yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on. . . \"\nHe strode away from them into the forest and out of sight. \"God, this place is going to the dogs,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"That oaf teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" Harry repeated. \"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you\n\"Oooooooh! \" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock. Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures. \"Gee up, there! \" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence. \"Hippogriffs! \" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau'iful, aren' they? \"\nHarry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. \"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --\"\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached the fence cautiously. \"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,\" said Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do. \"\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson. \"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,\" Hagrid continued. \"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt. \"Right -- who wants ter go first? \"\nMost of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being tethered like this. \"No one? \" said Hagrid, with a pleading look. \"I'll do it,\" said Harry. There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and Parvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves! \"\nHarry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence. \"Good man, Harry! \" roared Hagrid. \"Right then -- let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak. \"\nHe untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed maliciously. \"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink. . . . Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too much. . . . \"\nHarry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with one fierce orange eye. \"Tha's it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha's it, Harry. . . now, bow. \"\nHarry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak, but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up. The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move. \"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry, easy does it\nBut then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow. \"Well done, Harry! \" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on! \"\nFeeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it. The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed. \"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him! \"\nThis was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick; but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same. \"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an' mind yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that. . . . \"\nHarry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers. \"Go on, then'\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters. Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry, he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings. Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak, then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He just managed to hold on and push himself straight again. \"Good work, Harry! \" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go? \"\nEmboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful. \"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him. \"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it. . . . I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you? \" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you great ugly brute? \"\nIt happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes. \"I'm dying! \" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I'm dying, look at me! It's killed me! \"\n\"Yer not dyin'! \" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me -- gotta get him outta here --\"\nHermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily."

                "text": "\"\nHarry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class. \"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --\"\n\"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\" said Hermione quickly, \"and we're just about to start --\"\n\"Be quiet,\" said Snape coldly. \"I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization. \"\n\"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,\" said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever. \"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss --\"\nHarry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn't covered. \"Werewolves,\" said Snape. \"But, sir,\" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, \"we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --\"\n\"Miss Granger,\" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \"I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394. \" He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now! \"\nWith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened their books. \"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf? \" said Snape. Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air. \"Anyone? \" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. \"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between --\"\n\"We told you,\" said Parvati suddenly, \"we haven't got as far as werewolves yet, we're still on --\"\n\"Silence! \" snarled Snape. \"Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. . . . \"\n\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \"the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf --\"\n\"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\" said Snape coolly. \"Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all. \"\nHermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \"You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told? \"\nThe class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath. \"Detention, Weasley,\" Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's. \"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed. \"\nNo one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin. \"Very poorly explained. . . That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn't have given it three. . . . \"\nWhen the bell rang at last, Snape held them back. \"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention. \"\nHarry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape. \"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to Hermione. \"Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because of the boggart? \"\n\"I don't know,\" said Hermione pensively. \"But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. . . . \"\nRon caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage. \"D'you know what that --\" (he called Snape something that made Hermione say \"Ron! \") \"-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic! \" He was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. \"Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He could have finished him off for us! \"\nHarry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright -- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear. \"What did you do that for? \" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling. Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory. As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside. \"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\" Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \"There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and chase them. Go on,\" he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot. \"Leave Scabbers alone. \"\nThe noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light\nand speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course. Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up\nthe boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone. \"Stand and fight, you mangy cur! \" yelled Sir Cadogan. \"Oh, shut up,\" Harry yawned. He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. \"It's going to be a tough one,\" said Wood, who wasn't eating anything. \"Stop worrying, Oliver,\" said Alicia soothingly, \"we don't mind a bit of rain. \"\nBut it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium. The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him. The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this? The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field, wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words, \"Mount Your brooms. ,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off\nHarry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain. Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn't seen them coming. He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart. . . . With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud. \"I called for time-out! \" Wood roared at his team. \"Come on, under here --\"\nThey huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes. \"What's the score? \"\n\"We're fifty points up,\" said Wood, \"but unless we get the Snitch soon, we'll be playing into the night. \"\n\"I've got no chance with these on,\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses. At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming. \"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick! \"\nHe handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, \"Impervius! \"\n\"There! \" she said, handing them back to Harry. \"They'll repel water! \"\nWood looked as though he could have kissed her. \"Brilliant! \" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. \"Okay, team, let's go for it! \"\nHermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction. . . . There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly -\nHe turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats. Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished. \"Harry! \" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. \"Harry, behind you! \"\nHarry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them -\nWith a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the Snitch. \"Come on! \" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face."

                "text": "'Taster! \"\nBut something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf -- what was going on? And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field below. . . Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down. At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. . . . Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head. . . a woman. . . \"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry! \"\n\"Stand aside, you silly girl. . . stand aside, now. . . . \"\n\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\"\nNumbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain. . . . What was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her. . . She was going to die. . . . She was going to be murdered. . . . He was falling, falling through the icy mist. \"Not Harry! Please. . . have mercy. . . have mercy. . . . A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more. \"Lucky the ground was so soft. \"\n\"I thought he was dead for sure. \"\n\"But he didn't even break his glasses. \"\nHarry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten. \"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. \"\nScariest. . . the scariest thing. . . hooded black figures. . . cold . . . screaming. . . Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool. \"Harry! \" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. \"How're you feeling? \"\nIt was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors. . . \"What happened? \" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped. \"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet? \"\n\"We thought you'd died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking. Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot. \"But the match,\" said Harry. \"What happened? Are we doing a replay? \"\nNo one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone. \"We didn't -- lose? \"\n\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square. . . even Wood admits it. \"\n\"Where is Wood? \" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there. \"Still in the showers,\" said Fred. \"We think he's trying to drown himself. \"\nHarry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly. \"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before. \"\n\"There had to be one time you didn't get it,\" said George. \"It's not over yet,\" said Fred. \"We lost by a hundred points\"\n\"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin --. \"\n\"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\" said George. \"But if they beat Ravenclaw. . . \"\n\"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff. . . \"\n\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way. \"\nHarry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost. . . for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match. After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace. \"We'll come and see you later,\" Fred told him. \"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had. \"\nThe team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed. \"Dumbledore was really angry,\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away. . . He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him --\"\n\"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\" said Ron. \"And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --\"\nHis voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him. . . about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say. \"Did someone get my Nimbus? \"\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at each other. \"Er --\"\n\"What? \" said Harry, looking from one to the other. \"Well. . . when you fell off, it got blown away,\" said Hermione hesitantly. \"And? \"\n\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow. \"\nHarry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds. \"And? \" he said, dreading the answer. \"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It -- it doesn't like being hit. \"\n\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice. Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick. CHAPTER TEN\nTHE MARAUDER'S MAP\nMadam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn't argue or complain, but he wouldn't let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn't help it; he felt as though he'd lost one of his best friends. He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn't blame\nhim in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better, because they knew only half of what was troubling him. He hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione, because he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast? And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents. Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had heard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard the last moments of his mother's life, her attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother's voice. It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve', if he had to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from Gryffindor. \"If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving off,\" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch. \"Check who's in there, Hermione. \"\nHermione peered around the classroom door. \"It's okay! \"\nProfessor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill. \"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework? \"\n\"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment! \"\n\"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet? \" Lupin asked, frowning slightly. The babble broke out again. \"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --\"\n\"-- two rolls of parchment! \"\nProfessor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face. \"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the essay. \"\n\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I've already finished it! \"\nThey had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and harmless looking. \"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes. \"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people follow the light -- then --\"\nThe hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass. When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door, Harry among them, but --\n\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word. \"\nHarry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's box with a cloth. \"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits. \"\nLupin sighed. \"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance. \"\n\"Did you hear about the dementors too? \" said Harry with difficulty. Lupin looked at him quickly. \"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds. . . . I suppose they were the reason you fell? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself. \" Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --? \"\n\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry's mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have. \"\nA ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face. \"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them."

You have nothing to feel ashamed of. \"\n\"When they get near me --\" Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat tight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum. \"\nLupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then --\n\"Why did they have to come to the match? \" said Harry bitterly. \"They're getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with a snap. \"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up. . . . I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement . . . emotions running high. . . it was their idea of a feast. \"\n\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly. \"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought. Most of them go mad within weeks. \"\n\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got away. . . \"\nLupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to catch it. \"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible. . . . Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long. . . . \"\n\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly. \"There are -- certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist. \"\n\"What defenses? \" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me? \"\n\"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary. . . \"\n\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them --\"\nLupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said, \"Well. . . all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill. \"\nWhat with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances. Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was very grateful. To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term. \"We can do all our Christmas shopping there! \" said Hermione. \"Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes! \"\nResigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own. On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet. \"Psst -- Harry! \"\nHe turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed witch. \"What are you doing? \" said Harry curiously. \"How come you're not going to Hogsmeade? \"\n\"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\" said Fred, with a mysterious wink. \"Come in here. . . . \"\nHe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry. \"Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\" he said. Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George's jokes, stared at it. \"What's that supposed to be? \"\n\"This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\" said George, patting the parchment fondly. \"It's a wrench, giving it to you,\" said Fred, \"but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours. \"\n\"Anyway, we know it by heart,\" said George. \"We bequeath it to you. We don't really need it anymore. \"\n\"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment? \" said Harry. \"A bit of old parchment! \" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. \"Explain, George. \"\n\"Well. . . when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and innocent --\"\nHarry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been innocent. \"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother with Filch. \"\n\"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason --\"\n\"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual --\" detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous. \"Don't tell me --\" said Harry, starting to grin. \"Well, what would you've done? \" said Fred. \"George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed -- this. \"\n\"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,\" said George. \"We don't reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it. \"\n\"And you know how to work it? \"\n\"Oh yes,\" said Fred, smirking. \"This little beauty's taught us more than all the teachers in this school. \"\n\"You're winding me up,\" said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of parchment. \"Oh, are we? \" said George. He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. \"\nAnd at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:\nMessrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\nPurveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE MARAUDER'S MAP\nIt was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else. This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them seemed to lead -\n\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. \"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" -- he pointed them out -- \"but we're sure we're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked. And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times. And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone's hump. \"\n\"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the heading of the map. \"We owe them so much. \"\n\"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\" said Fred solemnly. \"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don't forget to wipe it after you've used it or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly. \"Just tap it again and say, 'Mischief managed! ' And it'll go blank. \"\n\"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy, \"mind you behave yourself. \"\n\"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking. They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way. Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If Filch really didn't know. . . he wouldn't have to pass the dementors at all. . . . But even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory. Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain. This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against. . . . Aids for Magical Mischief Makers. . . but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone. . . and Fred and George had been using it for years without anything horrible happening. . . . Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger. Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map, stuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the one-eyed witch. What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside said, \"Dissendium. \"\n\"Dissendium! \" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again. At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward. He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was\npitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos! \" and saw that he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed! \" The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off. The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else."

                "text": "Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned; Snape's mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard's hat at once. \"Dig in! \" he advised the table, beaming around. As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized dragonfly. \"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise! \" said Dumbledore, standing up. \"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,\" said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, \"and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. . . . \"\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Let me draw you up a chair --\"\nAnd he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream. I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die! \"\n\"We'll risk it, Sibyll,\" said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. \"Do sit down, the turkey's getting stone cold. \"\nProfessor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. \"Tripe, Sibyll? \"\nProfessor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, \"But where is dear Professor Lupin? \"\n\"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves. \"Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day. \"\n\"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll? \" said Professor McGonagall, her eyebrows raised. Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look. \"Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. \"But one does not parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous. \"That explains a great deal,\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty. \"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --\"\n\"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly. I doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's conversation, \"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you've made the potion for him again? \"\n\"Yes, Headmaster,\" said Snape. \"W -- what? \" said Harry, scrambling to his feet. \"Why? \"\n\"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down --\"\n\"Strip it down? \" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad. \"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free. \"\n\"There's nothing wrong with it! \" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly. \"Honestly, Professor --\"\n\"You can't know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly, \"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed. \"\nProfessor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. \"What did you go running to McGonagall for? Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood up and faced Ron defiantly. \"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black! \"\nCHAPTER TWELVE\nTHE PATRONUS\nHarry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he didn't know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests? Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again. Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. \"Had a good Christmas? \" he said, and then, without waiting for an answer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, \"I've been, doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one. . . I mean. . . we can't afford you to -- well --\"\nWood broke off, looking awkward. \"I'm working on it,\" said Harry quickly. \"Professor Lupin said he'd train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He said he'd have time after Christmas. \"\n\"Ah,\" said Wood, his expression clearing. \"Well, in that case -- I really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw! \"\n\"He got a Firebolt for Christmas,\" said Ron. \"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt? \"\n\"Don't get excited, Oliver,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I haven't got it anymore. It was confiscated. \" And he explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes. \"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed? \"\n\"Sirius Black\" Harry said wearily. \"He's supposed to be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it. \"\nWaving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker, Wood said, \"But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's on the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick? \"\n\"I know,\" said Harry, \"but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --\"\nWood went pale. \"I'll go and talk to her, Harry,\" he promised. \"I'll make her see reason. . . . A Firebolt. . . a real Firebolt, on our team. . . She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do. . . . I'll make her see sense. A Firebolt. . . \"\nClasses started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen. It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to; after his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible. \"Ah yes,\" said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. \"Let me see. . . how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough. . . . I'll have to think carefully about how we're going to do this. . . . We can't bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on. . . . \"\n\"Still looks ill, doesn't he? \" said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner. \"What d'you reckon's the matter with him? \"\nThere was a loud and impatient \"tuh\" from behind them. It was Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn't close. \"And what are you tutting at us for? \" said Ron irritably. \"Nothing,\" said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her shoulder. \"Yes, you were,\" said Ron. \"I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and you --\"\n\"Well, isn't it obvious? \" said Hermione, with a look of maddening superiority. \"If you don't want to tell us, don't,\" snapped Ron. \"Fine,\" said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off. \"She doesn't know,\" said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. \"She's just trying to get us to talk to her again. \"\nAt eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto Professor Binn's desk. \"What's that? \" said Harry. \"Another boggart,\" said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \"I've been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we're not using him; there's a cupboard under my desk he'll like. \"\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor. \"So. . . \" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm. \"\n\"How does it work? \" said Harry nervously. \"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin, \"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor. \"\nHarry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it. \"\n\"What does a Patronus look like? \" said Harry curiously. \"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it. \"\n\"And how do you conjure it? \"\n\"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory. \"\nHarry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had happened to him at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. \"Right,\" he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach. \"The incantation is this --\" Lupin cleared his throat. \"Expecto patronum! \"\n\"Expecto patronum, \" Harry repeated under his breath, \"expecto patronum. \"\n\"Concentrating hard on your happy memory? \"\n\"Oh -- yeah --\" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride."

If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground. \"\n\"You said it's harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry. \"I have complete confidence in you,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Here -- you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't have tried it before --\"\nHe pulled two bottles out of his briefcase. \"Butterbeer! \" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff! \"\nLupin raised an eyebrow. \"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied quickly. I see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well -- let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm supposed to take sides, as a teacher. . . \" he added hastily\nThey drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd been wondering for a while. \"What's under a dementor's hood? \"\nProfessor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully. \"Hmmm. . . well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon. \"\n\"What's that? \"\n\"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,\" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile. \"It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul. \"\nHarry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. \"What -- they kill --? \"\n\"Oh no,\" said Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. . . anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever. . . lost. \"\nLupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It's the fate that awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him. \"\nHarry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black. \"He deserves it,\" he said suddenly. \"You think so? \" said Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves that? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For. . . for some things. . . \"\nHe would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'd gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be very impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom. Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs. \"Do watch where you're going, Potter! \"\n\"Sorry, Professor --\"\n\"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well, here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend somewhere, Potter. . . . \"\nHarry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever. \"I can have it back? \" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously? \"\n\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night. . . . \"\nSpeechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from ear to ear. \"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow? \"\n\"Yeah. . . anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. \"You know what -- we should make up with Hermione. . . . She was only trying to help. . . . \"\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. \"She's in the common room how working, for a change --\"\nThey turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance. \"I wrote them down! \" Neville was saying tearfully. \"But I must've dropped them somewhere! \"\n\"A likely tale! \" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \"Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within! \"\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville. \"I've lost the passwords! \" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them! \"\n\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his Firebolt. \"Where'd you get it, Harry? \"\n\"Will you let me have a go? \" \"Have you ridden it yet, Harry? \"\n\"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens! \"\n\"Can I just hold it, Harry? \"\nAfter ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron approached her table and at last, she looked up. \"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the Firebolt. \"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it! \" said Ron. \"Well -- there might have been! \" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe! \"\n\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs. \"\n\"I'll take it! \" said Ron eagerly. \"I've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic. \"\nHe took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys' staircase. \"Can I sit down, then? \" Harry asked Hermione. \"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair. Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over. \"How are you getting through all this stuff? \" Harry asked her. \"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,\" said Hermione. Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin. \"Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects? \" Harry asked, watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary. \"I couldn't do that! \" said Hermione, looking scandalized. \"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very complicated-looking number chart. \"Oh no, it's wonderful! \" said Hermione earnestly. \"It's my favorite subject! It's --\"\nBut exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out. At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys' staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet. \"LOOK! \" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table. \"LOOK! \" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face. \"Ron, what --? \"\n\"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS! \"\nHermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it. Something that looked horribly like --\n\"BLOOD! \" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \"HE'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR? \"\n\"N -- no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice. Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs. CHAPTER THIRTEEN\nGRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\nIt looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up. Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical Menagerie. Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too. \"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would! \" she said shrilly. \"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do! \"\nRon had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed. \"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said Fred bracingly. \"And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he probably didn't feel a thing. \"\n\"Fred! \" said Ginny indignantly. \"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\" said George. \"He bit Goyle for us once! \" Ron said miserably. \"Remember, Harry? \"\n\"Yeah, that's true,\" said Harry. \"His finest hour,\" said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \"Let the scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's the point of moaning? \"\nIn a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd finished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment (\"Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it? \") so they set off for the Quidditch field together. Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion. \"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after a few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they've stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too. . . . \"\nShe continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, \"Er -- Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice. . . . \"\n\"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter,\" said Madam Hooch. \"I'll sit over here with Weasley. . . . \"\nShe and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's match. \"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good. . . . I really hoped she wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries. . . ."

                "text": "Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the lead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd. \"Yes! \" Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes! \"\n\"Well done, Harry! \" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me --\"\n\"Good for you, Harry! \" roared Seamus Finnigan. \"Ruddy brilliant! \" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling Gryffindors. \"That was quite some Patronus,\" said a voice in Harry's ear. Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased. \"The dementors didn't affect me at all! \" Harry said excitedly. \"I didn't feel a thing! \"\n\"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Come and see -- \"\nHe led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field. \"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,\" said Lupin. Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall. \"An unworthy trick! \" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now! \"\nIf anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry's side, doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it. \"Come on, Harry! \" said George, fighting his way over. \"Party! Gryffindor common room, now! \"\n\"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle. It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets. \"How did you do that? \" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd. \"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" Fred muttered in Harry's ear. Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her. \"Did you even come to the match? \" he asked her. \"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not looking up. \"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday. \"\n\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet. \"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read! \" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway. . . \" She glanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn't want me to join in. \"\nThere was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, \"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --\"\nHermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight. \"Can't you give her a break? \" Harry asked Ron quietly. \"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something. \"\nThe Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep. . . . He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his Firebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a clearing and -\n\"AAARRGGHH! NOOO! \"\nHarry woke as suddenly as though he'd been hit in the face. Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear movements around him, and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of the room: \"What's going on? \"\nHarry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the divide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp. Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of utmost terror on his face. \"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife! \"\n\"What? \"\n\"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up! \"\n\"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron? \" said Dean. \"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here! \"\nThey all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and sleepy voices called after them. \"Who shouted? \"\n\"What're you doing? \"\nThe common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted. \"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron? \"\n\"I'm telling you, I saw him! \"\n\"What's all the noise? \"\n\"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed! \"\nA few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing. \"Excellent, are we carrying on? \" said Fred Weasley brightly. \"Everyone back upstairs! \" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke. \"Perce -- Sirius Black! \" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up! \"\nThe common room went very still. \"Nonsense! \" said Percy, looking startled. \"You had too much to eat, Ron -- had a nightmare --\"\n\"I'm telling you --\"\n\"Now, really, enough's enough! \"\nProfessor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously around. \"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you! \"\n\"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor! \" said Percy, puffing himself up indignantly. \"I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare --\"\n\"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE! \" Ron yelled. \"PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE! \"\nProfessor McGonagall stared at him. \"Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole? \"\n\"Ask him! \" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan's picture. \"Ask him if he saw --\"\nGlaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated breath. \"Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower? \" \"Certainly, good lady! \" cried Sir Cadogan. There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room. \"You -- you did? \" said Professor McGonagall. \"But -- but the password! \"\n\"He had 'em! \" said Sir Cadogan proudly. \"Had the whole week's, my lady! Read 'em off a little piece of paper! \"\nProfessor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk. \"Which person,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around? \"\nThere was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks. Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised his hand slowly into the air. CHAPTER FOURTEEN\nSNAPE'S GRUDGE\nNo one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped. Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely nervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs. Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it. \"D'you reckon we should tell someone? \" Harry asked Ron. \"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,\" said Ron dismissively. \"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into. \"\nHarry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again. Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely shaken by the night's events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened, with a wealth of detail. \". . . I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft. . . I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down. . . . I rolled over. . . and I saw him standing over me. . . like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great long knife, must've been twelve inches. . . and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled, and he scampered. \"Why, though? \" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. \"Why did he run? \"\nHarry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep. \"He must've known he'd have a job getting back out of the castle once you'd yelled and woken people up,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He'd've had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole. . . then he would' ve met the teachers. . . . \"\nNeville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower. Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him."

                "text": "None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black's break-in, she sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive over breakfast -- a Howler. The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite him, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from his mother the year before. \"Run for it, Neville,\" Ron advised. Neville didn't need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding it before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family. Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist. \"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig. \"\nHarry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:\nDear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid\n\"He probably wants to hear all about Black! \" said Ron. So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance hall. Hagrid was already waiting for them. \"All right, Hagrid! \" said Ron. \"S'pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you? \"\n\"I've already heard all abou' it,\" said Hagrid, opening the front doors and leading them outside. \"Oh,\" said Ron, looking slightly put out. The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door. \"What are they for, Hagrid? \" said Harry. \"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus. . . . \"\nHarry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds. Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with Hagrid's cooking. I got somethin' ter discuss with you two,\" said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious. \"What? \" said Harry. \"Hermione,\" said Hagrid. \"What about her? \" said Ron. \"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat --\"\n\"-- ate Scabbers! \" Ron interjected angrily. \"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly. \"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case, mind. . . . She's found some really good stuff fer me. . . reckon he'll stand a good chance now. . . \"\n\"Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --\" Harry began awkwardly. \"I'm not blamin' yeh! \" said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. \"Gawd knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's all. \"\nHarry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks. \"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to her --\"\n\"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again! \" Ron said angrily. \"But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she won't hear a word against it! \"\n\"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,\" said Hagrid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's pillow. They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back up to the castle. A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room. \"Hogsmeade, next weekend! \" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the new notice. \"What d'you reckon? \" he added quietly to Harry as they went to sit down. \"Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes. . . . \" Harry said, even more quietly. \"Harry! \" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her. \"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again. . . I'll tell Professor McGonagall about that map! \" said Hermione. \"Can you hear someone talking, Harry? \" growled Ron, not looking at Hermione. \"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --\"\n\"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled! \" said Ron furiously. \"Haven't you done enough damage this year? \"\nHermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls' dormitories. \"So how about it? \" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no interruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet! \"\nHarry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time. \"\nOn Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder's Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors. \"'Bye! \" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back! \"\nRon grinned and winked. Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom. Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Dissendium! \" and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville came around the corner. \"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either! \"\n\"Hi, Neville,\" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket. \"What are you up to? \"\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Neville. \"Want a game of Exploding Snap? \"\n\"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin --\"\n\"I'll come with you! \" said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either! \"\n\"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night! \"\n\"Great, you can help me! \" said Neville, his round face anxious. \"I don't understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it, or --\"\nHe broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder. It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry. \"And what are you two doing here? \" said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other. \"An odd place to meet --\"\nTo Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch. \"We're not -- meeting here,\" said Harry. \"We just -- met here. \"\n\"Indeed? \" said Snape. \"You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason. . . . I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong. \"\nHarry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the one-eyed witch's head, examining it closely. Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending he'd left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose. The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office. He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself inside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute. He wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run. Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back. It's me,\" he muttered. \"What kept you? \" Ron hissed. \"Snape was hanging around. \"\nThey set off up the High Street. \"Where are you? \" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. \"Are you still there? This feels weird. . . . \"\nThey went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (\"Local Deliveries Only\"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's hand. Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece. The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden. \"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\" said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it. \"I asked Nearly Headless Nick. . . he says he's heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. . . . \"\nHarry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking. \". . . should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm. . . about how I couldn't use it for three months. . . . \"\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered. \"I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself. . . 'There's no 'arm in 'im, 'onest that hippogriff's as good as dead --\"\nMalfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin."

                "text": "They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus. CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY'S PREDICTION\nHarry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake. But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their O. W. L. s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N. E. W. T. s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione. Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column read:\nMonday\n9 o'clock, Arithmancy\n9 o'clock, Transfiguration\nLunch\n1 o'clock, Charms\n1 o'clock, Ancient Runes\n\"Hermione? \" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. \"Er -- are you sure you've copied down these times right? \"\n\"What? \" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it. \"Yes, of course I have. \"\n\"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at once? \" said Harry. \"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica? \"\n\"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid. \"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed,\" Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. \"Bin cooped up too long. But still. . . we'll know day after tomorrow -- one way or the other --\"\nThey had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away. Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over. Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart. \"Excellent, Harry,\" Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. \"Full marks. \"\nFlushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. \"Hermione! \" said Lupin, startled. \"What's the matter? \"\n\"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall! \" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \"Sh -- she said I'd failed everything! \"\nIt took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps. Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry. \"Hello there, Harry! \" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background. \"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \"Pity. . . pity. . . \"\nHe sighed deeply and looked down at Harry. \"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in. \"\n\"Does that mean the appeal's already happened? \" Ron interrupted, stepping forward. \"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron. \"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A! \" said Eon stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off! \"\nBefore Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this. . . . Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge? \"\nThe black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall. \"Why'd you stop me? \" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice! \"\n\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss! \" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak. . . . \"\nBut Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in. Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying. \"She's seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball? \" he asked them unhappily. \"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry. knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started. The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay? \"\nBut they all refused to say. \"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a horrible accident! \" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing. \"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud. \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock. \"Wish she'd hurry up. . . \"\nParvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride. \"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry and Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff. . . Well, good luck! \"\nShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender. \"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid. Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder. \"How'd it go? \" Harry asked him, standing up. \"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don't think she was convinced, though. . . . \"\n\"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's voice called, \"Harry Potter! \"\nThe tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball. \"Good day, my dear,\" she said softly. \"If you would kindly gaze into the Orb. . . . Take your time, now. . . then tell me what you see within it. . . . \"\nHarry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened. \"Well? \" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see? \"\nThe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend. \"Er --\" said Harry, \"a dark shape. . . um. . . \"\n\"What does it resemble? \" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now. . . \"\nHarry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak. \"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly. \"Indeed! \" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer. . . Does the hippogriff appear to. . . have its head? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly. \"Are you sure? \" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it? \"\n\"No! \" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick. \"No blood? No weeping Hagrid? \"\n\"No! \" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat. \"It looks fine, it's - - flying away. . . \"\nProfessor Trelawney sighed. \"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there. . . . A little disappointing. . . but I'm sure you did your best. \"\nRelieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him. \"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT. \"\nHarry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging. \"S -- sorry? \" said Harry. But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him. Her eyes started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own:\n\"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS."

                "text": "They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus. CHAPTER SIXTEEN\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY'S PREDICTION\nHarry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake. But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were about to take their O. W. L. s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his N. E. W. T. s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than Percy was Hermione. Harry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column read:\nMonday\n9 o'clock, Arithmancy\n9 o'clock, Transfiguration\nLunch\n1 o'clock, Charms\n1 o'clock, Ancient Runes\n\"Hermione? \" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. \"Er -- are you sure you've copied down these times right? \"\n\"What? \" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it. \"Yes, of course I have. \"\n\"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at once? \" said Harry. \"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica? \"\n\"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid. \"Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed,\" Hagrid told them, bending low on the pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. \"Bin cooped up too long. But still. . . we'll know day after tomorrow -- one way or the other --\"\nThey had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try as Harry might, he couldn't get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away. Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it would all be over. Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart. \"Excellent, Harry,\" Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk, grinning. \"Full marks. \"\nFlushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. \"Hermione! \" said Lupin, startled. \"What's the matter? \"\n\"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall! \" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. \"Sh -- she said I'd failed everything! \"\nIt took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps. Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing there staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry. \"Hello there, Harry! \" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly finished? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background. \"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. \"Pity. . . pity. . . \"\nHe sighed deeply and looked down at Harry. \"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in. \"\n\"Does that mean the appeal's already happened? \" Ron interrupted, stepping forward. \"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking curiously at Ron. \"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A! \" said Eon stoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off! \"\nBefore Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I'm getting too old for this. . . . Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge? \"\nThe black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall. \"Why'd you stop me? \" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch. \"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice! \"\n\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss! \" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak. . . . \"\nBut Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she was saying. All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join in. Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies. They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying. \"She's seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball? \" he asked them unhappily. \"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry. knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started. The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class hissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay? \"\nBut they all refused to say. \"She says the crystal ball's told her that if I tell you, I'll have a horrible accident! \" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing. \"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud. \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock. \"Wish she'd hurry up. . . \"\nParvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride. \"She says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry and Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff. . . Well, good luck! \"\nShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender. \"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid. Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the ladder. \"How'd it go? \" Harry asked him, standing up. \"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.

Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. . . . \"\n\"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke? \"\n\"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing, directly at Lupin. CHAPTER NINETEEN\nTHE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT\nHermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he'd received a huge electric shock. \"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing the cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin's chest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you. . . . \"\nSnape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. \"You're wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here? \" he said, his eyes glittering. \"I've just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did. . . lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight. \"\n\"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him. \"I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout --\"\n\"Severus, you're making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry --\"\n\"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming fanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this. . . . He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin. . . a tame werewolf --\"\n\"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban? \"\nBANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black's eyes. \"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will. \"\nBlack stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred. Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe. He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what they've got to say, w -- would it? \"\n\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\" Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your tongue. \"\n\"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\n\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL! \" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! \" A few sparks shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's face. Hermione fell silent. \"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would be the one to catch you. . . . \"\n\"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll come quietly. . . . \"\n\"Up to the castle? \" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black. . . pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay. . . I --\"\nWhat little color there was in Blacks face left it. \"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the rat --\"\nBut there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen before. He seemed beyond reason. \"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\nBefore he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door. \"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\"\n\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\" Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he just finish me off then? \"\n\"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape. \"Get out of the way, Potter. \"\n\"YOURE PATHETIC! \" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT! \" Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER! \"\nHarry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand. \"Expelliarmus! \" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had been knocked out. Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks. \"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry. \"You should have left him to me. . . . \"\nHarry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the right thing. \"We attacked a teacher. . . We attacked a teacher. . . \" Hermione whimpered, staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble --\"\nLupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them. \"Thank you, Harry,\" he said. \"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin. \"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy -- give me Peter, please. Now. \"\nRon clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. \"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean. . . \" He looked up at Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban? \"\n\"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was? \"\nBlack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others. It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was Scabbers. \"How did you get this? \" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. \"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's shoulder. . . I knew him at once. . . how many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts. . . to where Harry was. . . \"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again. \"His front paw. . . \"\n\"What about it? \" said Ron defiantly. \"He's got a toe missing,\" said Black. \"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple. . . so brilliant. . . he cut it off himself? \"\n\"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and sped down into the sewer with the other rats. . . . \"\n\"Didn't you ever hear, Ron? \" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger. \"\n\"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's been in my family for ages, right --\"\n\"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was living so long? \"\n\"We -- we've been taking good care of him! \" said Ron. \"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he? \" said Lupin. \"I'd guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again. . . . \"\n\"He's been scared of that mad cat! \" said Ron, nodding toward Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed. But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly. . . Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks. . . ever since Ron's return from Egypt. . . since the time when Black had escaped. . . . \"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. \"He's the most intelligent of his kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me. . . . Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and he's been helping me. . . \"What do you mean? \" breathed Hermione. \"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't. . . so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. . . . As I understand it, he took them from a boy's bedside table. . . . \"\nHarry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing. It was absurd. . . and yet. . . \"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it. \" croaked Black. \"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets. . . . I supposed he bit himself. . . Well, faking his own death had worked once. \"\nThese words jolted Harry to his senses. \"And why did he fake his death? \" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents! \"\n\"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry-\"\n\"And now you've come to finish him off! \"\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. \"Then I should've let Snape take you! \" Harry shouted. \"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don't you see? All this time we've thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\"\n\"THAT'S NOT TRUE! \" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM! \"\nHe was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright. \"Harry. . . I as good as killed them,\" he croaked."

                "text": "He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop. Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs began to shake. \"Oh, my --\" Hermione gasped. \"He didn't take his potion tonight! He's not safe! \"\n\"Run,\" Black whispered. \"Run. Now. \"\nBut Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt forward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back. \"Leave it to me -- RUN! \"\nThere was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks's hair was on end again; he was backing away --\nAs the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from Harry's side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other. Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him --\nPettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay motionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap. \"Expelliarmus. \" Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew; Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. \"Stay where you are! \" Harry shouted, running forward. Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass. There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --\n\"Sirius, he's gone, Pettigrew transformed! \" Harry yelled. Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry's words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds. Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron. \"What did he do to him? \" Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn't seem to recognize them. \"I don't know. . . . \"\nHarry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone. . . they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair. \"We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone,\" said Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. \"Come --\"\nBut then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. . . . \"Sirius,\" Harry muttered, staring into the darkness. He had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --\nHarry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it must mean -\nThe yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours, his hands over his head. 'Nooo,\" he moaned. 'Nooo. . . please. . . . \"\nAnd then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them. . . . \"Herrnione, think of something happy! \" Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it --\nI'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys. He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: \"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum! \"\nBlack gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death. He'll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him. \"Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum! \"\n\"Expecto --\" Hermione whispered, \"expecto -- expecto --\"\nBut she couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer. . . . \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his ears. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"\nA thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was alone. . . completely alone. . . . \"Expecto -- expecto patronum --\"\nHarry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With a huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent -- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him --\n\"Ex ecto patronum! \" he gasped. By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt, very close to him. It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mist Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside. \"No -- no --\" Harry gasped. \"He's innocent. . . expecto expecto patronum --\"\nHe could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood. Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth. . . a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn't move or speak. His Patronus flickered and died. White fog was blinding him. He had to fight. . . expecto patronum . . . he couldn't see. . . and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming. . . expecto patronum. . . he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm. . . they weren't going to take him. . . . But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward. . . . He could feel its breath. . . . It was going to get rid of him first. . . . He could feel its putrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in his ears. . . . She was going to be the last thing he ever heard --\nAnd then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter. . . He felt himself fall forward onto the grass. . . . Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding light was illuminating the grass around him. . . . The screaming had stopped, the cold was ebbing away. . . Something was driving the dementors back. . . . It was circling around him and Black and Hermione. . . . They were leaving. . . . The air was warm again. . . . With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the lake. . . . Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was. . . . It was as bright as a unicorn. . . . Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back. . . raising his hand to pat it. . . someone who looked strangely familiar . . . but it couldn't be. . . Harry didn't understand. He couldn't think anymore. He felt the last of his strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted. CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\nHERMIONE'S SECRET\nShocking business. . . shocking. . . miracle none of them died. . . never heard the like. . . by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape. . . . \"\n\"Thank you, Minister. \"\n\"Order of Merlin, Second Class, I'd say. First Class, if I can wangle it! \"\n\"Thank you very much indeed, Minister. \"\n\"Nasty cut you've got there. . . . Black's work, I suppose? \"\n\"As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister. . . . \"\n\"No! \"\n\"Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren't responsible for their actions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape. . . . They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They've got away with a great deal before now. . . I'm afraid it's given them a rather high opinion of themselves. . . and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --\"\n\"Ah, well, Snape. . . Harry Potter, you know. . . we've all got a bit of a blind spot where he's concerned. \"\n\"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too --\"\n\"Well, well. . . we shall see, Snape, we shall see. . . . The boy has undoubtedly been foolish. . . . \"\nHarry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand. . . . His limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. . . . He wanted to lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. . . . \"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors. . . you've really no idea what made them retreat, Snape? \"\n\"No, Minister. . . by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances. . . . \"\n\"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --\"\n\"All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to the castle. \"\nThere was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach. . . . He opened his eyes. Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he could make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed. Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm. Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar, and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from the corridor outside. Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed. He turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder. \"Ah, you're awake! \" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer. \"How's Ron? \" said Harry and Hermione together. \"He'll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. \"As for you two you'll be staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you think you're doing? \"\nHarry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his wand. \"I need to see the headmaster,\" he said. \"Potter,\" said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, \"it's all right. They've got Black. He's locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now --\"\n\"WHAT? \"\nHarry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same."

                "text": "They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses, paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could, skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the forest. . . . Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting. \"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's. . . . Keep out of sight, Harry. . . . \"\nThey made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own voice. \"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off. \"\n\"Yeh shouldn've come! \" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the door quickly. \"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,\" Harry said fervently. \"Let's move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to Buckbeak! \"\nThey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch. \"Now? \" Harry whispered. \"No! \" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's tied outside! \"\n\"That's going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was starting to seem impossible. At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's cabin. \"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment --\"\nSure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of surprise. \"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we -- we just run in there and grab Pettigrew --\"\n\"No! \" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --\"\n\"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid! \"\n\"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house? \" said Hermione. \"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --\"\n\"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time. . . . Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake! \"\n\"Okay! \" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\nBut Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps. \"We're about to come out! \" Hermione breathed. And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch. \"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay. . . \" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin'. \"\n\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n\"We'll tell them what really happened\n\"They can't kill him --\"\n\"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all! \"\nHarry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron. \"Go quick. Don' listen. . . . \"\nThere was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone. . . but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door. \"Where is the beast? \" came the cold voice of Macnair. \"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked. Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge. \"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --\"\nMacnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never. \"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I'll do it. \"\nAs Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak. \"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --\"\nCareful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence. \". . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai. . . \"\n\"Come on, Buckbeak,\" Harry murmured, \"come on, we're going to help you. Quietly. . . quietly. . . \"\n\". . . as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. . . \"\nHarry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet. \"Well, let's get this over with,\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member from inside Hagrid's cabin. \"Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside --\"\n\"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him. . . . I don' wan' him ter be alone --\"\nFootsteps echoed from within the cabin. \"Buckbeak, move! \" Harry hissed. Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. \"One moment, please, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore's voice. \"You need to sign too. \" The footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little faster. Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree. \"Harry, hurry! \" she mouthed. Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin. He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They had reached the trees. . . . \"Quick! Quick! \" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all. \"Stop! \" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\nHagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently. Silence. . . then --\n\"Where is it? \" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is the beast? \"\n\"It was tied here! \" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just here! \"\n\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in his voice. \"Beaky! \" said Hagrid huskily. There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs. \"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy! \"\nBuckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop him. \"Someone untied him! \" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search the grounds, the forest. \"\n\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot? \" said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. \"Search the skies, if you will. . . . Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy. \"\n\"O' -- o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with happiness. \"Come in, come in. . . . \"\nHarry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more. \"Now what? \" whispered Harry, looking around. \"We'll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He won't be there for another couple of hours. . . . Oh, this is going to be difficult. . . . \"\nShe looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest. The sun was setting now. \"We're going to have to move,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"We've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on. \"\n\"Okay,\" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. \"But we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. . . . \"\nThey moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow. \"There's Ron! \" said Harry suddenly. A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night air. \"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\nAnd then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive. \"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\n\"There's Sirius! \" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize Ron. . . . \"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it? \" said Harry, watching the dog pulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--\"\nThe Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze. \"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\" said Hermione. \"And there we go. . . \" Harry muttered. \"We're in. \"\nThe moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle. \"Right after we'd gone down into the passage! \" said Hermione. \"If only Dumbledore had come with us. . . \"\n\"Macnair and Fudge would've come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot. . . . \"\nThey watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --\n\"Here comes Lupin! \" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely. They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots. \"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lying there. . . . \"\nHe turned to Hermione. \"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --\"\n\"Harry, we mustn't be seen! \"\n\"How can you stand this? \" he asked Hermione fiercely. \"Just standing here and watching it happen? \" He hesitated. \"I'm going to grab the cloak! \"\n\"Harry, no! \"\nHermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands. \"See? \" Hermione whispered. \"See what would have happened? We've got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!"

Harry scrambled to his feet. \"I'm going to see him,\" he said to Ron and Hermione. \"But if he's resigned --\"\n\"-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --\"\n\"I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here. \"\nLupin's office door was open. He had already packed most of his things. The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door. \"I saw you coming,\" said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map. \"I just saw Hagrid,\" said Harry. \"And he said you'd resigned. It's not true, is it? \"\n\"I'm afraid it is,\" said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents. \"Why? \" said Harry. \"The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping Sirius, do they? \"\nLupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry. \"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives. \" He sighed. \"That was the final straw for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er -- accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast. \"\n\"You're not leaving just because of that! \" said Harry. Lupin smiled wryly. \"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents. . . . They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you. . . . That must never happen again. \"\n\"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had! \" said Harry. \"Don't go! \"\nLupin shook his head and didn't speak. He carried on emptying his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, \"From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud of anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned. . . . Tell me about your Patronus. \"\n\"How d'you know about that? \" said Harry, distracted. \"What else could have driven the dementors back? \"\nHarry told Lupin what had happened. When he'd finished, Lupin was smiling again. \"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,\" he said. \"You guessed right. . . that's why we called him Prongs. \"\nLupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers, and turned to look at Harry. \"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,\" he said, handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. \"And. . . \" He hesitated, then held out the Marauder's Map too. \"I am no longer your teacher, so I don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it. \"\nHarry took the map and grinned. \"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to lure me out of school. . . you said they'd have thought it was funny. \"\n\"And so we would have,\" said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case. \"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle. \"\nThere was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket. It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn't look surprised to see Harry there. \"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,\" he said. \"Thank You, Headmaster. \"\nLupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank. \"Well -- good-bye, Harry,\" he said, smiling. \"It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage. . . . \"\nHarry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible. \"Good-bye, then, Remus,\" said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the office. Harry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there. \"Why so miserable, Harry? \" he said quietly. \"You should be very proud of yourself after last night. \"\n\"It didn't make any difference,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Pettigrew got away. \"\n\"Didn't make any difference? \" said Dumbledore quietly, \"It made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. \"\nTerrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible than ever before. . . Professor Trelawney's prediction! \"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange. \"\n\"Indeed? \" said Dumbledore. \"Er -- stranger than usual, you mean? \"\n\"Yes. . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said . . . she said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight. . . . She said the servant would help him come back to power. \" Harry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn't remember anything she'd said. Was it -- was she making a real prediction? \"\nDumbledore looked mildly impressed. \"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been. \" he said thoughtfully. \"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise. . . . \"\n\"But --\" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly? \"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back! \"\n\"It does not,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Hasn't your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew's life. \"\n\"But if he helps Voldemort back to power\n\"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt. . . . When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them. . . and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter. \"\n\"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew! \" said Harry. \"He betrayed my parents! \"\n\"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me. . . the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life. \"\nHarry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking. \"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\" he said gently. \"He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it. \"\nHarry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he could tell Dumbledore. . . \"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake . . . I thought I was seeing him. \" \"An easy mistake to make,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"I expect you'll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes. . . you have your mother's eyes. Harry shook his head. \"It was stupid, thinking it was him,\" he muttered. \"I mean, I knew he was dead. \"\n\"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night. \"\nIt took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said. Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night. . . . You found him inside yourself. \"\nAnd Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts. Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth. Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape. \"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement! \" he told the only person who would listen -- his girlfriend, Penelope. Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so\ncheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits. He certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation. \"Wonder what they'll give us next year? \" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily. \"Maybe a vampire,\" suggested Dean Thomas hopefully. It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's mind. He couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney's prediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on. . . his parents' best friend. . . . It would have been the next best thing to having his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn't help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible. The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape's behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't have thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him could increase, but it certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's thin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat. Percy had got his top-grade N. E. W. T. s; Fred and George had scraped a handful of O. W. L. s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the next day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest. As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news. \"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I've decided to drop Muggle Studies."

                "text": "All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping. . . \"\nThe villagers exchanged dark looks. \"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\" grunted a man at the bar. \"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\" said the landlord. \"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot? \" said an excited woman in the corner. \"Horrible temper,\" said Dot, nodding fervently. \"I remember, when he was a kid. . . \"\nBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles. But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him. Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything. The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death? As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. \"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say,\"\nsaid Dot in the Hanged Man. \"And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it. \"\nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair. The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \"tax reasons,\" though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them. Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him. It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire. Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night. The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly. He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick. On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond. The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful. \"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry. \"\n\"Later,\" said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up. \"Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail. \"\nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again. \"Where is Nagini? \" said the cold voice. \"I -- I don't know, My Lord,\" said the first voice nervously. \"She set out to explore the house, I think. . . \"\n\"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\" said the second voice. \"I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly. \"\nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again. \"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here? \"\n\"A week,\" said the cold voice. \"Perhapse longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over. \"\nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \"Quidditch,\" which was not a word at all. \"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord? \" said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear. ) \"Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over? \"\n\"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait. \"\nFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words \"Ministry of Magic,\" \"wizards,\" and \"Muggles. \" Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still. \"Your Lordship is still determined, then? \" Wormtail said quietly. \"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail. \" There was a note of menace in the cold voice now. A slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve. \"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord. \"\nAnother pause, more protracted, and then -- \"Without Harry Potter? \" breathed the second voice softly. \"I see. . . \"\n\"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy! \" said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. \"The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person --\"\n\"I could use another wizard,\" said the cold voice softly, \"that is true. . . \"\n\"My Lord, it makes sense,\" said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now. \"Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected --\"\n\"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder. . . perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me? \"\n\"My Lord! I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --\"\n\"Do not lie to me! \" hissed the second voice. \"I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. . . \"\n\"No! My devotion to Your Lordship --\"\n\"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini? \"\n\"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --\"\n\"Liar,\" breathed the second voice. \"I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care. Silence! \"\nWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. The the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss. \"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -- courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort's wrath --\"\n\"My Lord, I must speak! \" said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. \"All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha Jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder --\"\n\"If? \" whispered the second voice. \"If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition. . . Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --\"\n\"I am a faithful servant,\" said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice. \"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement. \"\n\"I found you,\" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \"I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins. \"\n\"That is true,\" said the second man, sounding amused."

                "text": "\"A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you? \"\n\"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --\"\n\"Liar,\" said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \"However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform. . . \"\n\"R-really, My Lord? What -- ? \" Wormtail sounded terrified again. \"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end. . . but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins. \"\n\"You. . . you. . . \" Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \"You. . . are going. . . to kill me too? \"\n\"Wormtail, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice silkily, \"why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns. . . \"\nWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech. \"We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail. \"\nOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement. He was dangerous -- a madman. And he was planning more murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger -- Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village. . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might. \"One more murder. . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts. . . Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet. . . I think I hear Nagini. . . \"\nAnd the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure. And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright. Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him -- But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap. There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. . . This man could talk to snakes. Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again. \"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\" it said. \"In-indeed, My Lord? \" said Wormtail. \"Indeed, yes,\" said the voice, \"According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say. \"\nFrank didn't have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open. A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face. \"Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners? \"\nThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn't see the speaker. the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog. Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a\nfirmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold. The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see the back of his head. \"You heard everything, Muggle? \" said the cold voice. \"What's that you're calling me? \" said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war. \"I am calling you a Muggle,\" said the voice coolly. \"It means that you are not a wizard. \"\n\"I don't know what you mean by wizard,\" said Frank, his voice growing steadier. \"All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You've done murder and you're planning more! And I'll tell youthis too,\" he added, on a sudden inspiration, \"my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back --\"\n\"You have no wife,\" said te cold voice, very quietly. \"Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows. . . he always knows. . . \"\n\"Is that right? \" said Frank roughly. \"Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you? \"\n\"But I am not a man, Muggle,\" said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. \"I am much, much more than a man. However. . . why not? I will face you. . . Wormtail, come turn my chair around. \"\nThe servant gave a whimper. \"You heard me, Wormtail. \"\nSlowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug. And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor. Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start. CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR\nHarry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin. He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window. Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging. harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. . . There had been two people he knew and one he didn't . . . He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember. . . The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. . . There had been a snake on a hearth rug. . . a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail. . . and a cold, high voice. . . the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought. . . He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. . . All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of\nhorror, which had awoken him. . . or had that been the pain in his scar? And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them. . . Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name. . . and they had been plotting to kill someone else. . . him! Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another. Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below. Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not even a cat. And yet. . . and yet. . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble. No, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . . But Voldemort couldn't be here, now. . . The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. . . Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room. Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless."

                "text": "Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry. \"Well,\" said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. \"Very - erm - very nice place you've got here. \"\nAs the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon's face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything. Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder. \"They run off eckeltricity, do they? \" he said knowledgeably. \"Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\" he added to Uncle Vernon. \"And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I'm mad, but there you are. \"\nUncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack. Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal\nhimself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley. \"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry? \" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation. \"Yep,\" said Harry, \"that's Dudley. \"\nHe and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear. \"Having a good holiday, Dudley? \" he said kindly. Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside. Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins. \"Ah, right,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Better get cracking then. \"\nHe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one. \"Incendio! \" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him. Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever. \"Off you go then, Fred,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Coming,\" said Fred. \"Oh no - hang on -\"\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction - big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers. Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \"the Burrow! \" Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished. \"Right then, George,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"you and the trunk. \"\nHarry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried \"the Burrow! \"\nand vanished too. \"Ron, you next,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"See you,\" said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted \"the Burrow! \" and disappeared. Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained. \"Well . . . 'bye then,\" Harry said to the Dursleys. They didn't say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement. \"Harry said good-bye to you,\" he said. \"Didn't you hear him? \"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. \"Honestly, I don't care. \"\nMr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry's shoulder. \"You aren't going to see your nephew till next summer,\" he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. \"Surely you're going to say good-bye? \"\nUncle Vernon's face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley's wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon's tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, \"Good-bye, then. \"\n\"See you,\" said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream. Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley's tongue - and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him. Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen\ntongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard. \"Not to worry, I can sort him out! \" he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley. \"No, really! \" said Mr. Weasley desperately. \"It's a simple process it was the toffee -my son Fred - real practical joker - but it's only an Engorgement Charm - at least, I think it is - please, I can correct it -\"\nBut far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic- stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace. \"Now really! \" said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. \"I'm trying to help! \"\nBellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament. \"Harry, go! Just go! \" Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. \"I'll sort this out! \"\nHarry didn't want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon's second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said \"the Burrow! \" His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon's hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley's tongue lolling around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames. CHAPTER FIVE - WEASLEYS' WIZARD WHEEZES\nHarry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys' kitchen fire. \"Did he eat it? \" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee \"Yeah,\" said Harry, straightening up. \"What was it? \"\n\"Ton-Tongue Toffee,\" said Fred brightly. \"George and I invented them, and we've been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . . \"\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers. \"How're you doing, Harry? \" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide. Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George's shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him. \"That wasn't funny Fred! \" he shouted. \"What on earth did you give that Muggle boy? \"\n\"I didn't give him anything,\" said Fred, with another evil grin. I just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to. \"\n\"You dropped it on purpose! \" roared Mr. Weasley. \"You knew he'd eat it, you knew he was on a diet -\"\n\"How big did his tongue get? \" George asked eagerly. \"It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it! \"\nHarry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again. \"It isn't funny! \" Mr. Weasley shouted. \"That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard-Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons \"We didn't give it to him because he's a Muggle! \" said Fred indignantly. \"No, we gave it to him because he's a great bullying git,\" said George. \"Isn't he, Harry? \"\n\"Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry earnestly. \"That's not the point! \" raged Mr. Weasley. \"You wait until I tell your mother -\"\n\"Tell me what? \" said a voice behind them. Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion. \"Oh hello, Harry, dear,\" she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. \"Tell me what, Arthur? \"\nMr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn't really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry's and Ron's friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron's younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet - she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow. \"Tell me what, Arthur? \" Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice. \"It's nothing, Molly,\" mumbled Mr. Weasley, \"Fred and George just - but I've had words with them -\"\n\"What have they done this time? \" said Mrs. Weasley. \"If it's got anything to do with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes -\"\n\"Why don't you show Harry where he's sleeping, Ron? \" said Hermione from the doorway."

                "text": "\"He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn't he? \"\n\"He should,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, \"but Ludo's always been a bit . . . well . . . lax about security. You couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had. \"\nThey trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain. \"Always the same,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \"We can't resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us. \"\nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY. \"Couldn't have a better spot! \" said Mr. Weasley happily. \"The field is just on the other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be. \" He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \"Right,\" he said excitedly, \"no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on Muggle land. We'll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn't be too difficult. . . . Muggles do it all the time. . . . Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start? \"\nHarry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents. All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent. \"We'll be a bit cramped,\" he called, \"but I think we'll all squeeze in. Come and have a look. \"\nHarry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs. Figg's house:\nThere were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats. \"Well, it's not for long,\" said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn't camp much anymore, poor fellow, he's got lumbago. \"\nHe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. \"We'll need water. . . . \"There's a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,\" said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions. \"It's on the other side of the field. \"\n\"Well, why don't you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then\" - Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans - \"and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire? \"\n\"But we've got an oven,\" said Ron. \"Why can't we just -\"\n\"Ron, anti-Muggle security! \" said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with anticipation. \"When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I've seen them at it! \"\nAfter a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys', though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans. Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that\nstretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries. Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent. \"How many times, Kevin? You don't - touch - Daddy's - wand - yecchh! \"\nShe had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy's yells - \"You bust slug! You bust slug! \"\nA short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls' toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, \"In broad daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose -\"\nHere and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES' INSTITUTE. Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited. \"Er - is it my eyes, or has everything gone green? \" said Ron. It wasn't just Ron's eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names. \"Harry! Ron! Hermione! \"\nIt was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor. \"Like the decorations? \" said Seamus, grinning. \"The Ministry's not too happy. \"\n\"Ah, why shouldn't we show our colors? \" said Mrs. Finnigan. \"You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You'll be supporting Ireland, of course? \" she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily. When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, \"Like we'd say anything else surrounded by that lot. \" I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents? \" said Hermione. \"Let's go and have a look,\" said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red - was fluttering in the breeze. The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl. \"Krum,\" said Ron quietly. \"What? \" said Hermione. \"Krum! \" said Ron. \"Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker! \"\n\"He looks really grumpy,\" said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them. \"'Really grumpy? \" Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. \"Who cares what he looks like? He's unbelievable. He's really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see. \"\nThere was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation. \"Just put them on, Archie, there's a good chap. You can't walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate's already getting suspicious -\nI bought this in a Muggle shop,\" said the old wizard stubbornly. \"Muggles wear them. \"\n\"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,\" said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers. \"I'm not putting them on,\" said old Archie in indignation. \"I like a healthy breeze 'round my privates, thanks. \"\nHermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away. Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry's House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before. \"Who d'you reckon they are? \" he said. \"They don't go to Hogwarts, do they? \"\n\"'Spect they go to some foreign school,\" said Ron. \"I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn't afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn't going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up. \"\nHarry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn't be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other. \"You've been ages,\" said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys' tents. \"Met a few people,\" said Ron, setting the water down. \"You've not got that fire started yet? \"\n\"Dad's having fun with the matches,\" said Fred. Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn't for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life. \"Oops! \" he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise. \"Come here, Mr. Weasley,\" said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly. At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for Harry's and Hermione's benefit; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested. \"That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. . . . Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he's with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he's had those horns for a while now. . . Hello, Arnie . ."

Ludo! \"\nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far, even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was\nsplashed across his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy. \"Ahoy there! \" Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement. \"Arthur, old man,\" he puffed as he reached the campfire, \"what a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming . . . and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements. . . . Not much for me to do! \"\nBehind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air. Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression. \"Ah - yes,\" said Mr. Weasley, grinning, \"this is my son Percy. He's just started at the Ministry - and this is Fred - no, George, sorry - that's Fred - Bill, Charlie, Ron - my daughter, Ginny and Ron's friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter. \"\nBagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry's name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry's forehead. \"Everyone,\" Mr. Weasley continued, \"this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is, it's thanks to him we've got such good tickets -\"\nBagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing. \"Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur? \" he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. \"I've already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first - I offered him nice odds, considering Ireland's front three are the strongest I've seen in years - and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match. \"\n\"Oh . . . go on then,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Let's see . . . a Galleon on Ireland to win? \"\n\"A Galleon? \" Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself. \"Very well, very well . . . any other takers? \"\n\"They're a bit young to be gambling,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Molly wouldn't like -\"\n\"We'll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,\" said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money, \"that Ireland wins - but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we'll throw in a fake wand. \"\n\"You don't want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that,\" Percy hissed, but Bagman didn't seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter. \"Excellent! I haven't seen one that convincing in years! I'd pay five Galleons for that! \"\nPercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval. \"Boys,\" said Mr. Weasley under his breath, \"I don't want you betting. . . . That's all your savings . . . . Your mother -\"\n\"Don't be a spoilsport, Arthur! \" boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. \"They're old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum'll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance. . . . I'll give you excellent odds on that one . . . . We'll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we. . . . \"\nMr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins' names. \"Cheers,\" said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes. Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley. \"Couldn't do me a brew, I suppose? I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number's making difficulties, and I can't understand a word he's saying. Barty'll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages. \"\n\"Mr. Crouch? \" said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement. \"He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll. . . \"\n\"Anyone can speak Troll,\" said Fred dismissively. \"All you have to do is point and grunt. \"\nPercy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil. \"Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo? \" Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all. \"Not a dicky bird,\" said Bagman comfortably. \"But she'll turn up. Poor old Bertha . . . memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my word for it. She'll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it's still July. \"\n\"You don't think it might be time to send someone to look for her? \" Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea. \"Barty Crouch keeps saying that,\" said Bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, \"but we really can't spare anyone at the moment. Oh - talk of the devil! Barty! \"\nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was. \"Pull up a bit of grass, Barry,\" said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him. \"No thank you, Ludo,\" said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice. \"I've been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box. \"\n\"Oh is that what they're after? \" said Bagman. I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent. \"\n\"Mr. Crouch! \" said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback. \"Would you like a cup of tea? \"\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. \"Yes - thank you, Weatherby. \"\nFred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle. \"Oh and I've been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,\" said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. \"Ali Bashir's on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets. \"\nMr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh. \"I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I've told him once I've told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen? \"\n\"I doubt it,\" said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. \"He's desperate to export here. \"\n\"Well, they'll never replace brooms in Britain, will they? \" said Bagman. \"Ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle, said Mr. Crouch. \"I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve - but that was before carpets were banned, of course. \"\nHe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law. \"So, been keeping busy, Barty? \" said Bagman breezily. \"Fairly,\" said Mr. Crouch dryly. \"Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo. \"\n\"I expect you'll both be glad when this is over? \" said Mr. Weasley. Ludo Bagman looked shocked. \"Glad! Don't know when I've had more fun. . . . Still, it's not as though we haven't got anything to took forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh? \"\nMr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman. \"We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details -\"\n\"Oh details! \" said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges. \"They've signed, haven't they? They've agreed, haven't they? I bet you anything these kids'll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it's happening at Hogwarts -\"\n\"Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,\" said Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman's remarks short. \"Thank you for the tea, Weatherby. \"\nHe pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily. \"See you all later! \" he said. \"You'll be up in the Top Box with me - I'm commentating! \"\nHe waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them Disapparated. \"What's happening at Hogwarts, Dad? \" said Fred at once. \"What were they talking about? \"\n\"You'll find out soon enough,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \"It's classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,\"\nsaid Percy stiffly. \"Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it. \"\n\"Oh shut up, Weatherby,\" said Fred. A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere. Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes - green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria - which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves. \"Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,\" Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backward and forward over Ron's hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him. \"Wow, look at these! \" said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials. \"Omnioculars,\" said the saleswizard eagerly. \"You can replay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they flash up a play-by- play breakdown if you need it."

                "text": "\"Slimy gits,\" Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. \"Everyone ready? \" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \"Minister - ready to go? \"\n\"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably. Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus! \" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen. . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup! \"\nThe spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans - A Risk With Every Mouthful! ) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0. \"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots! \"\nThe right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. \"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah! \"\nHe suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela! \"\n\"What are veel -? \"\nBut a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women. . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen. . . except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind. . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but would it be good enough? \"Harry, what are you doing? \" said Hermione's voice from a long way off. The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard. Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands. \"You'll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say. \"\n\"Huh? \" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field. Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly! \" she said. \"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman's voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air. . . for the Irish National Team Mascots! \"\nNext moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it - \"Excellent! \" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. \"Leprechauns! \" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold. \"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, \"for the Omnioculars! Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha! \"\nThe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you - Dimitrov! \"\nA scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters. \"Ivanova! \"\nA second scarlet-robed player zoomed out. \"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand - Krum! \"\n\"That's him, that's him! \" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own. Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen. \"And now, please greet - the Irish National Quidditch Team! \" yelled Bagman. \"Presenting - Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand - Lynch! \"\nSeven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \"Firebolt\" on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs. \"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa! \"\nA small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls. \"Theeeeeeeey're OFF! \" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran! \"\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums. HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \"TROY SCORES! \" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland! \"\n\"What? \" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle! \"\n\"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things! \"\nshouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily. Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed. Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy - Mullet - Mo ran! \" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters. The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal. \"Fingers in your ears! \" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle. \"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova - oh I say! \" roared Bagman. One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was - \"They're going to crash! \" screamed Hermione next to Harry. She was half right - at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats. \"Fool! \" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting! \"\n\"It's time-out! \" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch! \"\n\"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed! \" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course. . . . \"\nHarry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes. He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT -DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference. Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his\nFirebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far."

By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter. Harry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know. We'll hear anyone coming a mile off. \"\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them. Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained. \"Who's that? \" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \"What are you doing in here, all alone? \"\nThey looked at one another, surprised. \"Well - there's a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron. Bagman stared at him. \"What? \"\n\"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . . Bagman swore loudly. \"Damn them! \" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop! \"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he? \" said Hermione, frowning. \"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them. \"\nHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over. \"I hope the others are okay,\" said Hermione after a while. \"They'll be fine,\" said Ron. \"Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\" said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \"He's always said he'd like to get something on him. \"\n\"That'd wipe the smirk off old Draco's face, all right,\" said Ron. \"Those poor Muggles, though,\" said Hermione nervously. \"What if they can't get them down? \"\n\"They will,\" said Ron reassuringly. \"They'll find a way. \"\n\"Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic's out here tonight! \" said Hermione. \"I mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they've been drinking, or are they just -\"\nBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt. \"Hello? \" called Harry. There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision. \"Who's there? \" he said. And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell. \"MORSMORDRE! \"\nAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry's eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky. \"What the - ? \" gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared. For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation. Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn't understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn't see anyone. \"Who's there? \" he called again. \"Harry, come on, move! \" Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward. \"What's the matter? \" Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified. \"It's the Dark Mark, Harry! \" Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could. \"You-Know-Who's sign! \"\n\"Voldemort's - \"Harry, come on! \"\nHarry turned - Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum - the three of them\nstarted across the clearing - but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them. Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione. Without pausing to think, he yelled, \"DUCK! \"\nHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground. \"STUPEFY! \" roared twenty voices - there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards' wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness-- \"Stop! \" yelled a voice he recognized. \"STOP! That's my son! \"\nHarry's hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified. \"Ron - Harry\" - his voice sounded shaky - \"Hermione - are you all right? \"\n\"Out of the way, Arthur,\" said a cold, curt voice. It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch's face was taut with rage. \"Which of you did it? \" he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \"Which of you conjured the Dark Mark? \"\n\"We didn't do that! \" said Harry, gesturing up at the skull. \"We didn't do anything! \" said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \"What did you want to attack us for? \"\n\"Do not lie, sir! \" shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping - he looked slightly mad. \"You have been discovered at the scene of the crime! \"\n\"Barty,\" whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, \"they're kids, Barty, they'd never have been able to \"Where did the Mark come from, you three? \" said Mr. Weasley quickly. \"Over there,\" said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. \"There was someone behind the trees. . . they shouted words - an incantation -\"\n\"Oh, stood over there, did they? \" said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. \"Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy -\"\nBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione's words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees. \"We're too late,\" said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. \"They'll have Disapparated. \"\n\"I don't think so,\" said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric's father. \"Our Stunners went right through those trees. . . . There's a good chance we got them. . . \"Amos, be careful! \" said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth. A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout. \"Yes! We got them! There's someone here! Unconscious! It's - but - blimey. . \"You've got someone? \" shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. \"Who? Who is it? \"\nThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky. Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again. \"This - cannot - be,\" he said jerkily. \"No -\"\nHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky. \"No point, Mr. Crouch,\" Mr. Diggory called after him. \"There's no one else there. \"\nBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching. \"Bit embarrassing,\" Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky's unconscious form. \"Barty Crouch's house-elf. . . I mean to say. . . \"\n\"Come off it, Amos,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly, \"you don't seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark's a wizard's sign. It requires a wand. \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Mr. Diggory, \"and she had a wand. \"\n\"What? \" said Mr. Weasley. \"Here, look. \" Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. \"Had it in her hand. So that's clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand. \"\nJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green skull. \"The Dark Mark! \" he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. \"Who did it? Did you get them? Barry! What's going on? \"\nMr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching. \"Where have you been, Barty? \" said Bagman. \"Why weren't you at the match? Your elf was saving you a seat too - gulping gargoyles! \" Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. \"What happened to her? \"\n\"I have been busy, Ludo,\" said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. \"And my elf has been stunned. \"\n\"Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why - ? \"\nComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman's round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch. \"No! \" he said. \"Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn't know how! She'd need a wand, for a start! \"\n\"And she had one,\" said Mr. Diggory. \"I found her holding one, Ludo. If it's all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she's got to say for herself. \"\nCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, \"Ennervate! \"\nWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position. She caught sight of Mr. Diggory's feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs. \"Elf! \" said Mr. Diggory sternly. \"Do you know who I am? I'm a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!"

Why's it such a big deal? \"\n\"I told you, it's You-Know-Who's symbol, Ron,\" said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \"I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts. \"\n\"And it hasn't been seen for thirteen years,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly. \"Of course people panicked. . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again. \"\n\"I don't get it,\" said Ron, frowning. \"I mean. . . it's still only a shape in the sky. . . \"Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"The terror it inspired. . . you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside. . . . \" Mr. Weasley winced. \"Everyone's worst fear. . . the very worst. . There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \"Well, it didn't help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we'd got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They're having their memories modified right now. \"\n\"Death Eaters? \" said Harry. \"What are Death Eaters? \"\n\"It's what You-Know-Who's supporters called themselves,\" said Bill. \"I think we saw what's left of them tonight - the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway. \"\n\"We can't prove it was them, Bill,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Though it probably was,\" he added hopelessly. \"Yeah, I bet it was! \" said Ron suddenly . \"Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who! \"\n\"But what were Voldemort's supporters -\" Harry began. Everybody flinched - like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort's name. \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"What were You-Know-Who's supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point? \"\n\"The point? \" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. \"Harry, that's their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,\" he finished disgustedly. \"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark? \" said Ron. \"They'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they? \"\n\"Use your brains, Ron,\" said Bill. \"If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they'd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they'd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you? \"\n\"So. . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark. . . \" said Hermione slowly, \"were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away? \"\n\"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But I'll tell you this. . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I'd be very surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a Death Eater once, even if they're not now. . Listen, it's very late, and if your mother hears what's happened she'll be worried sick. We'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here. \"\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted:\nIt was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake - wide-awake, and worried. Three days ago - it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days - he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort's mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean? He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie's snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off. CHAPTER TEN - MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY\nMr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas. \"\n\"He'll be all right,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \"Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while. . . and that was a big thing they had to make him forget. \"\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane. \"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness! \"\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand. \"Arthur - I've been so worried - so worried-\"\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley's neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops. \"You're all right,\" Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, \"you're alive. . . . Oh boys. . And to everybody's surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together. \"Ouch! Mum - you're strangling us -\"\n\"I shouted at you before you left! \" Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. \"It's all I've\nbeen thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn't get enough OW. L. s? Oh Fred. . . George. . \"\n\"Come on, now, Molly, we're all perfectly okay,\" said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. \"Bill,\" he added in an undertone, \"pick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . . \"\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder. \"I knew it,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \"Ministry blunders. . . culprits not apprehended. . . lax security. . . Dark wizards running unchecked. . . national disgrace. . . Who wrote this? Ah. . . of course. . . Rita Skeeter. \"\n\"That woman's got it in for the Ministry of Magic! \" said Percy furiously. \"Last week she was saying we're wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn't specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans --\"\n\"Do us a favor, Perce,\" said Bill, yawning, \"and shut up. \"\n\"I'm mentioned,\" said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article. \"Where? \" spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey. \"If I'd seen that, I'd have known you were alive! \"\n\"Not by name,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Listen to this: 'If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry ofMagic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but reflising to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen. ' Oh really,\" said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \"Nobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods. . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she's printed that. \"\nHe heaved a deep sigh. \"Molly, I'm going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over. \"\n\"I'll come with you, Father,\" said Percy importantly. \"Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person. \"\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset. \"Arthur, you're supposed to be on holiday! This hasn't got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you? \"\n\"I've got to go, Molly,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I've made things worse. I'll just change into my robes and I'll be off. . . . \"\n\"Mrs. Weasley,\" said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \"Hedwig hasn't arrived with a letter for me, has she? \"\n\"Hedwig, dear? \" said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \"No. . . no, there hasn't been any post at all. \"\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \"All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron? \"\n\"Yeah. . . think I will too,\" said Ron at once. \"Hermione? \"\n\"Yes,\" she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs. \"What's up, Harry? \" said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them. \"There's something I haven't told you,\" Harry said. \"On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again. \"\nRon's and Hermione's reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck. \"But - he wasn't there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean - last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn't he? \"\n\"I'm sure he wasn't on Privet Drive,\" said Harry. \"But I was dreaming about him. . . him and Peter - you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill. . . someone. \"\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \"me,\" but couldn't bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did. \"It was only a dream,\" said Ron bracingly. \"Just a nightmare. \"\n\"Yeah, but was it, though? \" said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \"It's weird, isn't it? . . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort's sign's up in the sky again. \"\n\"Don't - say - his - name! \" Ron hissed through gritted teeth. \"And remember what Professor Trelawney said? \" Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \"At the end of last year? \"\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts."

Fred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning. \"Never had a lesson like it,\" said Fred. \"He knows, man,\" said Lee. \"Knows what? \" said Ron, leaning forward. \"Knows what it's like to be out there doing it,\" said George impressively. \"Doing what? \" said Harry. \"Fighting the Dark Arts,\" said Fred. \"He's seen it all,\" said George. \"Mazing,\" said Lee. Ron dived into his bag for his schedule. \"We haven't got him till Thursday! \" he said in a disappointed voice. CHAPTER FOURTEEN - THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES\nThe next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Nevihle detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads. \"You know why Snape's in such a foul mood, don't you? \" said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Moody. \"\nIt was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it - but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together -at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors - he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody's eye, whether magical or normal. \"I reckon Snape's a bit scared of him, you know,\" Harry said thoughtfully. \"Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\" said Ron, his eyes misting over, \"and bounced him all around his dungeon. . . \"\nThe Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody's first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson. \"Been in the -\"\n\"Library. \" Harry finished her sentence for her. \"C'mon, quick, or we won't get decent seats. \"\nThey hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher's desk, took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody's distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes. \"You can put those away,\" he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, \"those books. You won't need them. \"\nThey returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited. Moody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered. \"Right then,\" he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, \"I've had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you've had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures - you've covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right? \"\nThere was a general murmur of assent. \"But you're behind - very behind - on dealing with curses,\" said Moody. \"So I'm here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I've got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark -\"\n\"What, aren't you staying? \" Ron blurted out. Moody's magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled - the first time Harry had seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was\nnevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved. \"You'll be Arthur Weasley's son, eh? \" Moody said. \"Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I'm staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement. \"\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together. \"So - straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I'm supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I'm not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you're in the sixth year. You're not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore's got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you're up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you've never seen? A wizard who's about to put an illegal curse on you isn't going to tell you what he's about to do. He's not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I'm talking. \"\nLavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody's magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head. \"So. . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law? \"\nSeveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron's and Hermione's. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender. \"Er,\" said Ron tentatively, \"my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something? \"\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Moody appreciatively. \"Your father would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse. \"\nMoody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him - Ron hated spiders. Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, \"Imperio! \"\nThe spider leapt from Moody's hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance. Everyone was laughing - everyone except Moody. \"Think it's funny, do you? \" he growled. \"You'd like it, would you, if I did it to you? \"\nThe laughter died away almost instantly. \"Total control,\" said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over. \"I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats. . . \"\nRon gave an involuntary shudder. \"Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,\" said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. \"Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will. \"The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I'll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone's got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE! \" he barked, and everyone jumped. Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar. \"Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse? \"\nHermione's hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry's slight surprise, did Neville's. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring. \"Yes? \" said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville. \"There's one - the Cruciatus Curse,\" said Neville in a small but distinct voice. Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes. \"Your name's Longbottom? \" he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again. Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move. \"The Cruciatus Curse,\" said Moody. \"Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\"\nhe said, pointing his wand at the spider. \"Engorgio! \"\nThe spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody's desk as possible. Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \"Crucio! \"\nAt once, the spider's legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently - \"Stop it! \" Hermione said shrilly. \"\nHarry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville's hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified. Moody raised his wand. The spider's legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch. \"Reducio,\" Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar. \"Pain,\" said Moody softly. \"You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too. \"Right. . . anyone know any others? \"\nHarry looked around. From the looks on everyone's faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione's hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air. \"Yes? \" said Moody, looking at her. \"Avada Kedavra,\" Hermione whispered. Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron. \"Ah,\" said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \"Yes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra. . . the Killing Curse. \"\nHe put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody's fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface. Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding. \"Avada Kedavra! \" Moody roared. There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air - instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him. Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor. \"Not nice,\" he said calmly. \"Not pleasant. And there's no countercurse. There's no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he's sitting right in front of me. \"\nHarry felt his face redden as Moody's eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all. . . . So that was how his parents had died. . . exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies? Harry had been picturing his parents' deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he'd found out they had been murdered, ever since he'd found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents' whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry's father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run. . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry. . . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son. . . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry."

                "text": "\"\nIt was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another's shoulders to see what was causing the holdup. Without another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face. As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction. \"Anyone put their name in yet? \" Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly. \"All the Durmstrang lot,\" she replied. \"But I haven't seen anyone from Hogwarts yet. \"\n\"Bet some of them put it in last night after we'd all gone to bed,\" said Harry. \"I would've if it had been me. . . wouldn't have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again? \"\nSomeone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited. \"Done it,\" Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Just taken it. \"\n\"What? \" said Ron. \"The Aging Potion, dung brains,\" said Fred. \"One drop each,\" said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \"We only need to be a few months older. \"\n\"We're going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\"\nsaid Lee, grinning broadly. \"I'm not sure this is going to work, you know,\" said Hermione warningly. \"I'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this. \"\nFred, George, and Lee ignored her. \"Ready? \" Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. \"C'mon, then - I'll go first -\"\nHarry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley - Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line. For a split second Harry thought it had worked - George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards. The entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other's beards. \"I did warn you,\" said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \"I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours. \"\nFred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast. The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering. \"There's a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,\" Dean told Harry. \"That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth. \"\nHarry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust. \"We can't have a Slytherin champion! \"\n\"And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,\" said Seamus contemptuously. \"But I wouldn't have thought he'd have wanted to risk his good looks. \"\n\"Listen! \" said Hermione suddenly. People were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats\nand saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, \"Well, I've done it! Just put my name in! \"\n\"You're kidding! \" said Ron, looking impressed. \"Are you seventeen, then? \" asked Harry. \"Course she is, can't see a beard, can you? \" said Ron. \"I had my birthday last week,\" said Angelina. \"Well, I'm glad someone from Gryffindor's entering,\" said Hermione. \"I really hope you get it, Angelina! \"\n\"Thanks, Hermione,\" said Angelina, smiling at her. Yeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory, said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him. \"What're we going to do today, then? \" Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall. \"We haven't been down to visit Hagrid yet,\" said Harry. \"Okay,\" said Ron, \"just as long as he doesn't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts. \"\nA look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione's face. \"I've just realized - I haven't asked Hagrid to join S. P. E. W. yet! \" she said brightly. \"Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges? \"\n\"What is it with her? \" said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase. \"Hey, Ron,\" said Harry suddenly. \"It's your friend. . . \"\nThe students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly. Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks. \"What d'you reckon'll happen to the ones who aren't chosen? \" Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. \"Reckon they'll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament? \"\n\"Dunno,\" said Harry. \"Hang around, I suppose. . . . Madame Maxime's staying to judge, isn't she? \"\nWhen all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again. \"Where are they sleeping, then? \" said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them. A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione's reappearance with the box of S. P. E. W. badges. \"Oh good, hurry up,\" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime. As they neared Hagrid's cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons' sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid's front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it. Harry knocked on Hagrid's door, and Fang's booming barks answered instantly. \"Bout time! \" said Hagrid, when he'd flung open the door. \"Thought you lot'd forgotten where I live! \"\n\"We've been really busy, Hag -\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words. Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn't the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill's, but found he had too much hair. The look didn't really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \"Erm - where are the skrewts. \"\n\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\" said Hagrid happily. \"They're get-tin' massive, mus' be\nnearly three foot long now. On'y trouble is, they've started killin' each other. \"\n\"Oh no, really? \" said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid's odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it. \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid sadly. \"S' okay, though, I've got 'em in separate boxes now. Still got abou' twenty. \"\n\"Well, that's lucky,\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm. Hagrid's cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were. \"You wait,\" he said, grinning. \"You jus' wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh've never seen before. Firs' task. . . ah, but I'm not supposed ter say. \"\n\"Go on, Hagrid! \" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning. \"I don' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"But it's gonna be spectacular, I'll tell yeh that. Them champions're going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I'd live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again! \"\nThey ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn't eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet. A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join S. P. E. W. when she showed him her badges. \"It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione,\" he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \"It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insutin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em. \"\n\"But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it! \" said Hermione. \"And we heard he's asking for wages now! \"\n\"Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of 'em ter do it - no, nothin' doin', Hermione. \"\nHermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket. By half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast - and, more important, the announcement of the school champions. \"I'll come with yeh,\" said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \"Jus' give us a sec. \"\nHagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn't pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \"Hagrid, what's that? \"\n\"Eh? \" said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \"Don' yeh like it? \"\n\"Is that aftershave? \" said Hermione in a slightly choked voice. \"Er - eau de cologne,\" Hagrid muttered. He was blushing."

                "text": "Madame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled. \"What is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr? \" she said imperiously. \"I'd rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,\" said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. \"Two Hogwarts champions? I don't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions - or have I not read the rules carefully enough? \"\nHe gave a short and nasty laugh. \"C'est impossible,\" said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon Fleur's shoulder. \"Ogwarts cannot 'ave two champions. It is most injust. \"\n\"We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,\" said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. \"Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools. \"\n\"It's no one's fault but Potter's, Karkaroff,\" said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. \"Don't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter's determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here -\"\n\"Thank you, Severus,\" said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair. Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles. \"Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry? \" he asked calmly. \"No,\" said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows. \"Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you? \" said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape. \"No,\" said Harry vehemently. \"Ah, but of course 'e is lying! \" cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling. \"He could not have crossed the Age Line,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"I am sure we are all agreed on that -\"\n\"Dumbly-dorr must 'ave made a mistake wiz ze line,\" said Madame Maxime, shrugging. \"It is possible, of course,\" said Dumbledore politely. \"Dumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake! \" said Professor McGonagall angrily. \"Really, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I'm sure that should be good enough for everybody else! \"\nShe shot a very angry look at Professor Snape. \"Mr. Crouch. . . Mr. Bagman,\" said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, \"you are our -er - objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular? \"\nBagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice. \"We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament. \"\n\"Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,\" said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed. \"I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,\" said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. \"You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It's only fair, Dumbledore. \"\n\"But Karkaroff, it doesn't work like that,\" said Bagman. \"The Goblet of Fire's just gone out - it won't reignite until the start of the next tournament -\"\n\"- in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing! \" exploded Karkaroff. \"After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now! \"\n\"Empty threat, Karkaroff,\" growled a voice from near the door. \"You can't leave your champion now. He's got to compete. They've all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh? \"\nMoody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk. \"Convenient? \" said Karkaroff. \"I'm afraid I don't understand you, Moody. \"\nHarry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists. \"Don't you? \" said Moody quietly. \"It's very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter's name in that goblet knowing he'd have to compete if it came out. \"\n\"Evidently, someone 'oo wished to give 'Ogwarts two bites at ze apple! \" said Madame Maxime. \"I quite agree, Madame Maxime,\" said Karkaroff, bowing to her. \"I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards -\"\n\"If anyone's got reason to complain, it's Potter,\" growled Moody, \"but. . . funny thing. . . I don't hear him saying a word. . . \"Why should 'e complain? \" burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. \"E 'as ze chance\nto compete, 'asn't 'e? We 'ave all been 'oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money - zis is a chance many would die for! \"\n\"Maybe someone's hoping Potter is going to die for it,\" said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl. An extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, \"Moody, old man. . . what a thing to say! \"\n\"We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,\" said Karkaroff loudly. \"Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons. \"Imagining things, am I? \" growled Moody. \"Seeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy's name in that goblet. . . \"Ah, what evidence is zere of zat? \" said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands. \"Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object! \" said Moody. \"It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. . . . I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . . . \"\n\"You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,\" said Karkaroff coldly, \"and a very ingenious theory it is - though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you'll understand if we don't take you entirely seriously. . . . \"\n\"There are those who'll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,\" Moody retorted in a menacing voice. \"It's my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff - as you ought to remember. . . \"Alastor! \" said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized \"Mad-Eye\" could hardly be Moody's real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction - Karkaroff's face was burning. \"How this situation arose, we do not know,\" said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. \"It seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . \"Ah, but Dumbly-dorr -\"\n\"My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it. \"\nDumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She wasn't the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited. \"Well, shall we crack on, then? \" he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. \"Got to give our champions their instructions, haven't we? Barty, want to do the honors? \"\nMr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie. \"Yes,\" he said, \"instructions. Yes . . . the first task . . . \"\nHe moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup. \"The first task is designed to test your daring,\" he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, \"so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard. . . very important. \"The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges. \"The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests. \"\nMr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore. \"I think that's all, is it, Albus? \"\n\"I think so,\" said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern. \"Are you sure you wouldn't like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty? \"\n\"No, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . . I've left young Weatherby in charge. . . . Very enthusiastic. . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . . \"You'll come and have a drink before you go, at least? \" said Dumbledore. \"Come on, Barry, I'm staying! \" said Bagman brightly. \"It's all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office! \"\n\"I think not, Ludo,\" said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience. \"Professor Karkaroff - Madame Maxime - a nightcap? \" said Dumbledore. But Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur's shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence. \"Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. \"I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise. \"\nHarry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together. The Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality. \"So,\" said Cedric, with a slight smile. \"We're playing against each other again! \"\n\"I s'pose,\" said Harry. He really couldn't think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked. \"So. . . tell me. . . \" said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. \"How did you get your name in? \"\n\"I didn't,\" said Harry, staring up at him. \"I didn't put it in. I was telling the truth. \"\n\"Ah. . . okay,\" said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn't believe him. \"Well . . . see you, then. \"\nInstead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones. Was anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he'd put himself in for the tournament?"

He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim. \"Diffindo! \"\nCedric's bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed. \"Don't bother,\" said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. \"Tell Flitwick I'm coming, go on. . .

He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric's friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric. \"Hi,\" said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. \"My bag just split. . . brand-new and all. . . \"\n\"Cedric,\" said Harry, \"the first task is dragons. \"\n\"What? \" said Cedric, looking up. \"Dragons,\" said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \"They've got four, one for each of us, and we've got to get past them. \"\nCedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he'd been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric's gray eyes. \"Are you sure? \" Cedric said in a hushed voice. \"Dead sure,\" said Harry. \"I've seen them. \"\n\"But how did you find out? We're not supposed to know. . . . \"\n\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly - he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth. \"But I'm not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now - Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too. \"\nCedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes. \"Why are you telling me? \" he asked. Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn't have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn't have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared - well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape. . . \"It's just . . . fair, isn't it? \" he said to Cedric. \"We all know now. . . we're on an even footing, aren't we? \"\nCedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom. \"Come with me, Potter,\" he growled. \"Diggory, off you go. \"\nHarry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them? \"Er - Professor, I'm supposed to be in Herbology -\"\n\"Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he'd found out about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he'd be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet. . He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one. \"That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,\" Moody said quietly. Harry didn't know what to say; this wasn't the reaction he had expected at all. \"Sit down,\" said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around. He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart's day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror. On his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized\nit at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody's. In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus. \"Like my Dark Detectors, do you? \" s aid Moody, who was watching Harry closely. \"What's that? \" Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial. \"Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies. . . no use here, of course, too much interference - students in every direction lying about why they haven't done their homework Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn't stop whistling. It's extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,\" he added in a growl. \"And what's the mirror for? \"\n\"Oh that's my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I'm not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That's when I open my trunk. \"\nHe let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody's next question brought him sharply back to earth. \"So. . . found out about the dragons, have you? \"\nHarry hesitated. He'd been afraid of this - but he hadn't told Cedric, and he certainly wasn't going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules. \"It's all right,\" said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \"Cheating's a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been. \"\n\"I didn't cheat,\" said Harry sharply. \"It was - a sort of accident that I found out. \"\nMoody grinned. \"I wasn't accusing you, laddie. I've been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won't be. They'll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They'd like to prove he's only human. \"\nMoody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it. \"So. . . got any ideas how you're going to get past your dragon yet? \" said Moody. \"No,\" said Harry. \"Well, I'm not going to tell you,\" said Moody gruffly. \"I don't show favoritism, me. I'm just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is - play to your strengths. \"\n\"I haven't got any,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Excuse me,\" growled Moody, \"you've got strengths if I say you've got them. Think now. What are you best at? \"\nHarry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really -- \"Quidditch,\" he said dully, \"and a fat lot of help -\"\n\"That's right,\" said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \"You're a damn good flier from what I've heard. \"\n\"Yeah, but. . . \" Harry stared at him. \"I'm not allowed a broom, I've only got my wand. . . \"\n\"My second piece of general advice,\" said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \"is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need. \"\nHarry looked at him blankly. What did he need? \"Come on, boy. . . \" whispered Moody. \"Put them together. . . it's not that difficult. . . \"\nAnd it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Fire-bolt, he needed - \"Hermione,\" Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \"Hermione - I need you to help me. \"\n\"What d'you think I've been trying to do, Harry? \" she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning. \"Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon. \"\nAnd so they practiced. They didn't have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floor. \"Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . . \"\n\"What d'you think I'm trying to do? \" said Harry angrily. \"A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . Okay, try again. . . . \"\nHe wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths. \"Well, that's good,\" said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, \"just as long as it's not drawn-out. I don't want to suffer. \"\nRon looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry's eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn't entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms - perhaps the fly was just stupid. He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty. At two o'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville's toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm. \"That's better, Harry, that's loads better,\" Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased. \"Well, now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell,\" Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, \"threaten me with a dragon. Right. . . \" He raised his wand once more. \"Accio Dictionary! \"\nThe heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it. \"Harry, I really think you've got it! \" said Hermione delightedly. \"Just as long as it works tomorrow,\" Harry said. \"The Firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and I'm going to be out there on the grounds. . . . \"\n\"That doesn't matter,\" said Hermione firmly. \" Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep. . . you're going to need it. \"\nHarry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement."

                "text": "Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons' enclosure - though of course, they didn't yet know what they would find there. Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing \"We'll have a box of tissues ready, Potter\" as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn't just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch. . . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours? ), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were watching. \"Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task. \"\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter. \"Good luck, Harry,\" Hermione whispered. \"You'll be fine! \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own. He heft the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn't seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps\nand out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder. \"Now, don't panic,\" she said, \"just keep a cool head. . . . We've got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right? \"\n\"Yes,\" Harry heard himself say. \"Yes, I'm fine. \"\nShe was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view. \"You're to go in here with the other champions,\" said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \"and wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there. . . he'll be telling you the - the procedure. . . . Good luck. \"\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside. Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool. She didn't look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it. \"Harry! Good-o! \" said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \"Come in, come in, make yourself at home! \"\nBagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again. \"Well, now we're all here - time to fill you in! \" said Bagman brightly. \"When the audience has assembled, I'm going to be offering each of you this bag\" - he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them - \"from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different - er - varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too. . . ah, yes. . . your task is to collect the golden egg! \"\nHarry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman's words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn't reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. . And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then - it seemed like about a second later to Harry - Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack. \"Ladies first,\" he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour. She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon - a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming. The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn't even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground. Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs. \"Well, there you are! \" said Bagman. \"You have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I'm going to have to leave you in a moment, because I'm commentating. Mr. Diggory, you're first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now. . . Harry. . . could I have a quick word? Outside? \"\n\"Er. . . yes,\" said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face. \"Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you? \"\n\"What? \" said Harry. \"I - no, nothing. \"\n\"Got a plan? \" said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. \"Because I don't mind\nsharing a few pointers, if you'd like them, you know. I mean,\" Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, \"you're the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help. . . \"\n\"No,\" said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, \"no - I - I know what I'm going to do, thanks. \"\n\"Nobody would know, Harry,\" said Bagman, winking at him. \"No, I'm fine,\" said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. \"I've got a plan worked out, I -\"\nA whistle had blown somewhere. \"Good lord, I've got to run! \" said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off. Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt. Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds hater, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of his model. It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed. . . yelled. . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric's steps, around and around the tent. And Bagman's commentary made everything much, much worse. . . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry's mind as he heard: \"Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow\". . . \"He's taking risks, this one! \". . . \"Clever move - pity it didn't work! \"\nAnd then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg. \"Very good indeed! \" Bagman was shouting. \"And now the marks from the judges! \"\nBut he didn't shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd. \"One down, three to go! \" Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. \"Miss Delacour, if you please! \"\nFleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other's gaze. The same process started again. . . . \"Oh I'm not sure that was wise! \" they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. \"Oh. . . nearly! Careful now. . . good lord, I thought she'd had it then! \"\nTen minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur's marks were being shown. . . more clapping. . . then, for the third time, the whistle. \"And here comes Mr. Krum! \" cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone. He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear. . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away. \"Very daring! \" Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \"That's some nerve he's showing - and - yes, he's got the egg! \"\nApplause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished - it would be Harry's turn any moment. He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence. He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he'd last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, heaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn't know or care. It was time to do\nwhat he had to do. . . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance. He raised his wand. \"Accio Firebolt! \" he shouted. Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn't worked. . . if it wasn't coming. . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . . And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something. . . but Harry's ears were not working properly anymore. . . listening wasn't important. . . . He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened. . . . As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd's faces became mere flesh-colored pinpnicks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where he belonged. . . . This was just another Quidditch match, that was all. . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team. He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon's front legs. \"Okay,\" Harry told himself, \"diversionary tactics. . . let's go. . . \"\nHe dived. The Horntail's head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away. . . but Harry didn't care. . . that was no more than dodging a Bludger. \"Great Scott, he can fly! \" yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. \"Are you watching this, Mr."

I've just noticed. . . . \"\n\"Of course they are - did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me? \"\n\"No, I mean, they're different to how they were before he put that hex on you. . . . They're all. . . straight and - and normal-sized. \"\nHermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from the one he remembered. \"Well. . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,\" she said. \"And I just. . . let her carry on a bit. \" She smiled even more widely. \"Mum and Dad won't be too pleased. I've been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces. You know, they're dentists, they just don't think teeth and magic should - look! Pigwidgeons back! \"\nRon's tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, \"Oh look at the weeny owl! Isn't he cute? \"\nStupid little feathery git! \" Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. \"You bring letters to the addressee! You don't hang around showing off! \"\nPigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron's fist. The third-year girls all looked very shocked. \"Clear off! \" Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more\nhappily than ever as he soared through the air. \"Here - take it, Harry,\" Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius's reply off Pigwidgeons leg. Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it. Everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:\nDear Harry, Congratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in that goblet shouldn't be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitus Curse, as a dragon's eyes are its weakest point - \"That's what Krum did! \" Hermione whispered -but your way was better, I'm impressed. Don't get complacent, though. Harry. You've only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if they're trying to hurt you. Keep your eyes open -particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble. Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual. Sirius \"He sounds exactly like Moody,\" said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes. \"'Constant vigilance! ' You'd think I walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . . \"\n\"But he's right, Harry,\" said Hermione, \"you have still got two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it means. . . . \"\n\"Hermione, he's got ages! \" snapped Ron. \"Want a game of chess, Harry? \"\n\"Yeah, okay,\" said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione's face, he said, \"Come on, how'm I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I won't even be able to hear the egg over this lot. \"\n\"Oh I suppose not,\" she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron's, involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop. Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose. \"Dobby! \" Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed. \"Don't do that! \"\n\"Dobby is sorry, sir! \" squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth. \"Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter 'Merry Christmas' and bring him a present, Sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir! \"\nIt's okay,\" said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal. \"Just - just prod me or something in future, all right, don't bend over me like that. . . \"\nHarry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses from his bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired. \"Someone attacking you, Harry? \" Seamus asked sleepily. \"No, it's just Dobby,\" Harry muttered. \"Go back to sleep. \"\n\"Nah . . . presents! \" said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harrys bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy. \"Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present? \" he squeaked tentatively. \"'Course you can,\" said Harry. \"Er. . . I've got something for you too. \"\nIt was a lie; he hadn't bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneako-scope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, \"Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . \"\nBut Dobby was utterly delighted. \"Socks are Dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir! \" he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon's. \"I has seven now, sir. . . . But sir . . . \" he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, \"they has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same! \"\n\"Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that? \" said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. \"Tell you what, Dobby - here you go - take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here's your sweater. \"\nHe threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent, Dobby looked quite overwhelmed. \"Sir is very kind! \" he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. \"Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless -\"\n\"They're only socks,\" said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. \"Wow, Harry -\" He had just opened Harry's present, a Chudley Cannon hat. \"Cool! \" He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair. Dobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be - socks. \"Dobby is making them himself, sir! \" the elf said happily. \"He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir! \"\nThe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches. \"They're . . . they're really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,\" said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby's eyes to leak with happiness again. \"Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens! \" said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to Ron and the others as he passed. Harry's other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby's odd socks - with the obvious exception of the Dursleys', which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low -Harry supposed they too were remember ing the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harrys favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley's usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it - Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies. Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage's Wizarding Crackers. They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys' snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o'clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball. \"What, you need three hours? \" said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \"Who're you going with? \" he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle. There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture. \"Lairy fights, that's the one! \" she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside. Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was\njust no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn't done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs. \"I still can't work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\" muttered Dean. \"Animal magnetism,\" said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs. The common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn't giggling. \"You - er - look nice,\" he said awkwardly. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Padma's going to meet you in the entrance hall,\" she added to Ron. \"Right,\" said Ron, looking around. \"Where's Hermione? \"\nParvati shrugged. \"Shall we go down then, Harry? \"\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole."

Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach -Pulling the cloak back over himself Harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes\nscrewed up with fear. . . and, almost immediately -\"\nPEEVES! \"\nIt was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury. \"What's this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I'll have you, Peeves, I'll have you, you'll. . . and what is this? \"\nFilch's footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped -Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg still Jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no Peeves . . . but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder's Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show \"Harry Potter\" standing exactly where he was. \"Egg? \" Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. \"My sweet! \" - Mrs. Norris was obviously with him - \"This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school champion! \"\nHarry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast -\"\nPEEVES! \" Filch roared gleefully. \"You've been stealing! \"\nHe ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase. \"Hiding, are you? \" he said softly. \"I'm coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You've gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves. . . . Dumbledore'll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. . . . \"\nFilch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels. Mrs. Morris's lamp-like eyes, so very like her masters, were fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown - he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches - any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him -\"\nFilch? Whats going on? \"\nFilch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry's situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid. \"Its Peeves, Professor,\" Filch whispered malevolently. \"He threw this egg down the stairs. \"\nSnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second. . . . \"Peeves? \" said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch's hands. \"But Peeves couldn't get into my office. . . . \"\n\"This egg was in your office. Professor? \"\n\"Of course not,\" Snape snapped. \"I heard banging and wailing -\"\n\"Yes, Professor, that was the egg -\"\n\"- I was coming to investigate -\"\n\"- Peeves threw it. Professor -\"\n\"- and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it! \"\nBut Peeves couldn't -\"\n\"I know he couldn't, Filch! \" Snape snapped again. \"I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break! \" Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. \"I want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch. \"\n\"I - yes, Professor - but -\"\nFilch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go. . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch's legs. . . . Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him. . . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam? \"The thing is, Professor,\" said Filch plaintively, \"the headmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all -\"\n\"Filch, I don't give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it's my office that's -\"\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Snape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual. \"Pajama party, is it? \" he growled up the stairs. \"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\" said Filch at once. \"Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual - and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off -\"\n\"Shut up! \" Snape hissed to Filch. Moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moodys magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself. Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks. . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene:\nSnape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody's lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other's eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again. \"Did I hear that correctly, Snape? \" he asked slowly. \"Someone broke into your office? \"\n\"It is unimportant,\" said Snape coldly. \"On the contrary,\" growled Moody, \"it is very important. Who'd want to break into your office? \"\n\"A student, I daresay,\" said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape's greasy temple. \"It has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . . \"\n\"Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh? \" said Moody. \"Not hiding anything else in your office, are you? \"\nHarry saw the edge of Snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly. \"You know I'm hiding nothing, Moody,\" he said in a soft and dangerous voice, \"as you've searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself. \"\nMoodys face twisted into a smile. \"Auror's privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye -\"\n\"Dumbledore happens to trust me,\" said Snape through clenched teeth. \"I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office! \"\n\"Course Dumbledore trusts you,\" growled Moody. \"Hes a trusting man, isn't he? Believes in second chances. But me - I say there are spots that don't come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d'you know what I mean? \"\nSnape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him. Moody laughed. \"Get back to bed, Snape. \"\n\"You don't have the authority to send me anywhere! \" Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. \"I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do! \"\n\"Prowl away,\" said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. \"I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . . You've dropped something, by the way. . . . \"\nWith a stab of horror. Harry saw Moody point at the Marauders Map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing \"It's mine! Mine! \"\nSnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face -\"\nAccio Parchment! \"\nThe map flew up into the air, slipped through Snapes outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moodys hand. \"My mistake,\" Moody said calmly. \"It's mine - must've dropped it earlier -\"\nBut Snape's black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch's arms to the map in Moodys hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could. . . . \"Potter,\" he said quietly. \"What's that? \" said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it. \"Potter! \" Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. \"That egg is Potters egg. That\npiece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak! \"\nSnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out -trapped. Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snapes fingertips, but any moment now-\"\nThere's nothing there, Snape! \" barked Moody, \"but I'll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter! \"\n\"Meaning what? \" Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from Harry's chest. \"Meaning that Dumbledore's very interested to know who's got it in for that boy! \" said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. \"And so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . . \" The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever. Snape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn't see the expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands. \"I merely thought,\" said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, \"that if Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it's an unfortunate habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For - for his own safety. \"\n\"Ah, I see,\" said Moody softly. \"Got Potter's best interests at heart, have you? \"\nThere was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other, Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch's legs, looking for the source of Harry's bubble-bath smell. \"I think I will go back to bed,\" Snape said curtly. \"Best idea you've had all night,\" said Moody. \"Now, Filch, if you'll just give me that egg-\"\n\"No! \" said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son. \"Professor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves' treachery! \"\n\"It's the property of the champion he stole it from,\" said Moody. Hand it over, now. \"\nSnape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast. Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. \"Never mind. my sweet. . . we'll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him what Peeves was up to. . . . \"\nA door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step. \"Close shave. Potter,\" he muttered. \"Yeah . . . I - er . . . thanks,\" said Harry weakly. \"What is this thing? \" said Moody, drawing the Marauder's Map out of his pocket and unfolding it. \"Map of Hogwarts,\" said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him. \"Merlins beard,\" Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. \"This . . . this is some map. Potter! \"\n\"Yeah, its . . . quite useful,\" Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. \"Er - Professor Moody, d'you think you could help me - ? \"\n\"What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . ."

He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \"Well, I've no idea what that's about. . . but if Karkaroff s genuinely worried, and he's going to Snape for answers . . . \"\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration. \"There's still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn't, but I just can't see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he'd ever worked for Voldemort. \"\n\"Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snapes office then? \" said Ron stubbornly. \"Well,\" said Sirius slowly, \"I wouldn't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher's office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he's a different matter . . . is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not. . . what's he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn't turn up in the Top Box? What's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament? \"\nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron. \"You say your brother s Crouch's personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he's seen Crouch lately? \"\n\"I can try,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch. \"\n\"And you might try and find out whether they've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you're at it,\" said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet. \"Bagman told me they hadn't,\" said Harry. \"Yes, he's quoted in the article in there,\" said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \"Blustering on about how bad Bertha's memory is. Well, maybe she's changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn't forgetful at all - quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that's why Bagman didn't bother to look for her for so long. . . . \"\nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \"What's the time? \"\nHarry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake. \"It's half past three,\" said Hermione. \"You'd better get back to school,\" Sirius said, getting to his feet. \"Now listen . . . \"\nHe looked particularly hard at Harry. \"I don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you're not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you. \"\n\"No one's tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\" Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him. \"I don't care . . . I'll breathe freely again when this tournament's over, and that's not until June. And don't forget, if you're talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay? \"\nHe handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good-bye. \"I'll walk to the edge of the village with you,\" said Sirius, \"see if I can scrounge another paper. \"\nHe transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts. \"Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch? \" Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \"But maybe he doesn't care . . . It'd probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He'd just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son. \"\n\"Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\" said Hermione severely. \"I don't know,\" said Ron. \"If he thought we were standing in the way of his career . . . Percy's really ambitious, you know. . . . \"\nThey walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall. \"Poor old Snuffles,\" said Ron, breathing deeply. \"He must really like you. Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats. \"\nCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT - THE MADNESS OF MR CROUCH\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she'd had a job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks. The house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present. \"Harry Potter is too good to Dobby! \" he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes. \"You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,\" said Harry. \"No chance of more of those eclairs, is there? \" said Ron, who was looking around at the beaming and bowing house-elves. \"You've just had breakfast! \" said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves. \"We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,\" Harry muttered. \"Good idea,\" said Ron. \"Give Pig something to do. You couldn't give us a bit of extra food, could you? \" he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more. \"Dobby, where's Winky? \" said Hermione, who was looking around. \"Winky is over there by the fire, miss,\" said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly. \"Oh dear,\" said Hermione as she spotted Winky. Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup. \"Winky is getting through six bottles a day now,\" Dobby whispered to Harry. \"Well, it's not strong, that stuff,\" Harry said. But Dobby shook his head. \"'Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,\" he said. Winky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work. \"Winky is pining, Harry Potter,\" Dobby whispered sadly. \"Winky wants to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now. \"\n\"Hey, Winky,\" said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, \"you don't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament. \"\nWinky's eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, \"M - Master is stopped - hic - coming? \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"we haven't seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet's saying he's ill. \"\nWinky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry. \"Master- hic- ill? \"\nHer bottom lip began to tremble. \"But we're not sure if that's true,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Master is needing his - hie - Winky! \" whimpered the elf. \"Master cannot - hic - manage - hic - all by himself. . . . \"\n\"Other people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,\" Hermione said severely. \"Winky - hic - is not only - hic - doing housework for Mr. Crouch! \" Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. \"Master is - hic - trusting Winky with - hic - the most important - hic - the most secret. . . \"\n\"What? \" said Harry. But Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself. \"Winky keeps - hic - her master's secrets,\" she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. \"You is - hic - nosing, you is. \"\n\"Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter! \" said Dobby angrily. \"Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy! \"\n\"He is nosing - hic - into my master's - hic - private and secret - hic - Winky is a good house-elf- hic - Winky keeps her silence - hic - people trying to - hic - pry and poke -hic -\"\nWinky's eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view. \"We is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss! \" squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. \"We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss! \"\n\"She's unhappy! \" said Hermione, exasperated. \"Why don't you try and cheer her up instead\nof covering her up? \"\n\"Begging your pardon, miss,\" said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, \"but house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served. \"\n\"Oh for heavens sake! \" Hermione cried. \"Listen to me, all of you! You've got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You've got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don't have to do everything you're told - look at Dobby! \"\n\"Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,\" Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous. \"We has your extra food! \" squeaked an elf at Harry's elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry's arms. \"Good-bye! \"\nThe house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs. \"Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter! \" Dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky. \"You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione? \" said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. \"They won't want us visiting them now! We could've tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch! \"\n\"Oh as if you care about that! \" scoffed Hermione. \"You only like coming down here for the food! \"\nIt was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius's food up to the Owlery that evening on his own. Pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them. Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrids chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight."

I have long felt the Ministry is\nwrong to ally itself with such creatures. \"\n\"But for filth like this . . . \" Moody said softly. \"You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"Let us hear them, please. \"\n\"You must understand,\" said Karkaroff hurriedly, \"that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . .

People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely -\"\n\"These names are? \" said Mr. Crouch sharply. Karkaroff drew a deep breath. \"There was Antonin Dolohov,\" he said. \"I - I saw him torture countless Muggles and - and non-supporters of the Dark Lord. \"\n\"And helped him do it,\" murmured Moody. \"We have already apprehended Dolohov,\" said Crouch. \"He was caught shortly after yourself. \"\n\"Indeed? \" said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. \"I - I am delighted to hear it! \"\nBut he didn't look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless. \"Any others? \" said Crouch coldly. \"Why, yes . . . there was Rosier,\" said Karkaroff hurriedly. \"Evan Rosier. \"\n\"Rosier is dead,\" said Crouch. \"He was caught shortly after you were too. He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle. \"\n\"Took a bit of me with him, though,\" whispered Moody to Harry's right. Harry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore. \"No - no more than Rosier deserved! \" said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff's eyes darted toward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting. \"Any more? \" said Crouch. \"Yes! \" said Karkaroff. \"There was Travers - he helped murder the McKinnons! Mulciber -he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself! \"\nHarry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd was all murmuring together. \"Rookwood? \" said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. \"Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries? \"\n\"The very same,\" said Karkaroff eagerly. \"I believe he used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information -\"\n\"But Travers and Mulciber we have,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"Very well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide -\"\n\"Not yet! \" cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. \"Wait, I have more! \"\nHarry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard. \"Snape! \" he shouted. \"Severus Snape! \"\n\"Snape has been cleared by this council,\" said Crouch disdainfully. \"He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore. \"\n\"No! \" shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair. \"I assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater! \"\nDumbledore had gotten to his feet. \"I have given evidence already on this matter,\" he said calmly. \"Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort's downfall and\nturned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more a Death Eater than I am. \"\nHarry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind Dumbledore's back. \"Very well, Karkaroff,\" Crouch said coldly, \"you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. . . . \"\nMr. Crouch's voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own body - all else was swirling darkness. . . . And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day . . . a different trial. The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room. This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn't broken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile. \"Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"We have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment? \"\nHarry couldn't believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater? \"Only,\" said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, \"well - I know I've been a bit of an idiot -\"\nOne or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike. \"You never spoke a truer word, boy,\" someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. \"If I didn't know he'd always been dim, I'd have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain. . . . \"\n\"Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort's supporters,\"\nsaid Mr. Crouch. \"For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than -\"\nBut there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at Mr. Crouch. \"But I've told you, I had no idea! \" Bagman called earnestly over the crowd's babble, his round blue eyes widening. \"None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad's . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on . . . once my Quidditch days are over, you know . . . I mean, I can't keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I? \"\nThere were titters from the crowd. \"It will be put to the vote,\" said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon. \"The jury will please raise their hands . . . those in favor of imprisonment. . . \"\nHarry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. One of the witches on the jury stood up. \"Yes? \" barked Crouch. \"We'd just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,\" the witch said breathlessly. Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming. \"Despicable,\" Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon. \"Rookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . . \"\nAnd the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands. Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple. \"Bring them in,\" he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon. The door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to one another. The dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief. Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face. \"You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law,\" he said clearly, \"so that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous -\"\n\"Father,\" said the boy with the straw-colored hair. \"Father. . . please . . . \"- that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,\" said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son's voice. \"We have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -\"\n\"Father, I didn't! \" shrieked the boy in chains below. \"I didn't, I swear it. Father, don't send me back to the dementors -\"\n\"You are further accused,\" bellowed Mr. Crouch, \"of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom's wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury -\"\n\"Mother! \" screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward. \"Mother, stop him. Mother, I didn't do it, it wasn't me! \"\n\"I now ask the jury,\" shouted Mr. Crouch, \"to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban! \"\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream. \"No! Mother, no!"

The boys' three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, \"The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him! \"\nBut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle. \"I'm your son! \" he screamed up at Crouch. \"I'm your son! \"\n\"You are no son of mine! \" bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. \"I have no son! \"\nThe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed. \"Take them away! \" Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth. \"Take them away, and may they rot there! \"\n\"Father! Father, I wasn't involved! No! No! Father, please! \"\n\"I think. Harry, it is time to return to my office,\" said a quiet voice in Harrys ear. Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side. There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch's son being dragged away by the dementors - and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him. \"Come,\" said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harrys elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore's sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him. \"Professor,\" Harry gasped, \"I know I shouldn't've - I didn't mean - the cabinet door was sort of open and -\"\n\"I quite understand,\" said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him. Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze. \"What is it? \" Harry asked shakily. \"This? It is called a Pensieve,\" said Dumbledore. \"I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind. \"\n\"Er,\" said Harry, who couldn't truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort. \"At these times,\" said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, \"I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form. \"\n\"You mean . . . that stuff's your thoughts? \" Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin. \"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let me show you. \"\nDumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it - but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold. . . . and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape's, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly. \"It's coming back . . . Karkaroff's too . . . stronger and clearer than ever. . . \"\n\"A connection I could have made without assistance,\" Dumbledore sighed, \"but never mind. \"\nHe peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape's face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. \"I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention. \"\n\"I'm sorry,\" Harry mumbled. Dumbledore shook his head. \"Curiosity is not a sin,\" he said. \"But we should exercise caution with our curiosity. . . yes, indeed . . . \"\nFrowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as Snape's had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin. \"He put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him, sir, I only said I'd seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday. . . . \"\n\"But why. Bertha,\" said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, \"why did you have to follow him in the first place? \"\n\"Bertha? \" Harry whispered, looking up at her. \"Is that - was that Bertha Jorkins? \"\n\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. \"That was Bertha as I remember her at school. \"\nThe silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore's face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man. \"So, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something. \"\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Professor - I was in Divination just now, and - er - I fell asleep. \"\nHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, \"Quite understandable. Continue. \"\n\"Well, I had a dream,\" said Harry. \"A dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail-\"\n\"I do know,\" said Dumbledore promptly. \"Please continue. \"\n\"Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail's blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn't be fed to the snake - there was a snake beside his chair. He said - he said he'd be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail - and my scar hurt,\" Harry said. \"It woke me up, it hurt so badly. \"\nDumbledore merely looked at him. \"Er - that's all,\" said Harry. \"I see,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer? \"\n\"No, I - how did you know it woke me up over the summer? \" said Harry, astonished. \"You are not Sirius's only correspondent,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay. \"\nDumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his wand tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn't make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of color. \"Professor? \" he said quietly, after a couple of minutes. Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry. \"My apologies,\" he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk. \"D'you - d'you know why my scar's hurting me? \"\nDumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, \"I have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred. \"\n\"But. . . why? \"\n\"Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,\" said Dumbledore. \"That is no ordinary scar. \"\n\"So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen? \"\n\"It is possible,\" said Dumbledore. \"I would say - probable. Harry - did you see Voldemort? \"\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Just the back of his chair. But - there wouldn't have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn't got a body, has he? But. . . but then how could he have held the wand? \" Harry said slowly. \"How indeed? \" muttered Dumbledore. \"How indeed . . . \"\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve. \"Professor,\" Harry said at last, \"do you think he's getting stronger? \"\n\"Voldemort? \" said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even Moody's magical eye could not. \"Once again. Harry, I can only give you my suspicions. \"\nDumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever. \"The years of Voldemort's ascent to power,\" he said, \"were marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . . within these very grounds. And\nthere was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort's father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends. \"\nDumbledore looked very seriously at Harry. \"These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees - as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office. \"\nHarry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair. \"Professor? \" he said again. \"Yes, Harry? \" said Dumbledore. \"Er . . . could I ask you about. . . that court thing I was in . . . in the Pensieve? \"\n\"You could,\" said Dumbledore heavily. \"I attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others . . . particularly now. . . . \"\n\"You know - you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch's son? Well. . . . were they talking about Neville's parents? \"\nDumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. \" Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother? \" he said. Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him. \"Yes, they were talking about Nevilles parents,\" said Dumbledore. \"His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard. \"\n\"So they're dead? \" said Harry quietly. \"No,\" said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before. \"They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him. \"\nHarry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years, bothered to find out. . . \"The Longbottoms were very popular,\" said Dumbledore. \"The attacks on them came after Voldemort's fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms' evidence was - given their condition - none too reliable. \"\n\"Then Mr. Crouch's son might not have been involved? \" said Harry slowly. Dumbledore shook his head. \"As to that, I have no idea. \"\nHarry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt of living people. . . . \"Er,\" he said, \"Mr. Bagman . . . \"\n\". . ."

                "text": "it might even be painless . . . I would not know. . . I have never died. . . . \"\nHarry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope . . . no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort s feet. . . he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . . Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone. Harry stood up . . . he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort. Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \"Expelliarmus! \" Voldemort cried, \"Avada Kedavra! \"\nA jet of green light issued from Voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry's - they met in midair - and suddenly Harry's wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn't have released it if he'd wanted to - and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating. And then - nothing could have prepared Harry for this - he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort's father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands -The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . . \"Do nothing! \" Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry's; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \"Do nothing unless I command you! \"\nVoldemort shouted to the Death Eaters. And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. . . . It was coming from every thread of the light-spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song. It was the sound of hope to Harry. . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him. . . . It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . . Don't break the connection. I know. Harry told the music, I know I mustn't. . . but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too . . . it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands - Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the beams movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . . As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harrys wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers -He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra-hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . . One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemorts wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a moment. . . and then it connected. . . . At once, Voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then - Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock - a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail. . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemorts wand tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory. If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained\nunbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel. . . and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke. \"Hold on. Harry,\" it said. Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort . . . his wide red eyes were still shocked . . . he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly. Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome. . More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip . . . the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso . . . an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . . \"He was a real wizard, then? \" the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \"Killed me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . . \"\nBut already, yet another head was emerging . . . and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman's. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . . The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes. \"Don't let go, now! \" she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedrics as though from very far away. \"Don't let him get you, Harry - don't let go! \"\nShe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it. . . and Voldemort's dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn't hear to Voldemort. And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemorts wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be . . . he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the man appearing was the one he'd thought of more than any other tonight. . . . The smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his father. \"Your mother's coming . . . \" he said quietly. \"She wants to see you . . . it will be all right. . . hold on. . . . \"\nAnd she came. . . first her head, then her body. . . a young woman with long hair, the smoky, shadowy form of Lily Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort's wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like her husband. She walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and she spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . . . \"When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time. . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts . . . do you understand, Harry? \"\n\"Yes,\" Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers. \"Harry . . . \" whispered the figure of Cedric, \"take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents, . . . \"\n\"I will,\" said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand. \"Do it now,\" whispered his father's voice, \"be ready to run . . . do it now. . . . \"\n\"NOW! \" Harry yelled; he didn't think he could have held on for another moment anyway -he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died - but the shadowy figures of Voldemort's victims did not disappear - they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze -And Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones - he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric's body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do -\n\"Stun him! \" he heard Voldemort scream. Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel -\"\nImpedimenta! \" he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him. From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric's arm. . . \"Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine! \" shrieked Voldemort. Harry's hand had closed on Cedric's wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of reach -Voldemort's red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand. \"Accio! \" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup. It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle -He heard Voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked - it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back. CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE - VERITASERUM\nHarry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric's body. He felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . . A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. . . ."

She can turn -\"\nHermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag. \"- into a beetle. \"\n\"You're kidding,\" said Ron. \"You haven't. . . she's not. . . \"\n\"Oh yes she is,\" said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them. Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle. \"That's never - you're kidding -\" Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes. \"No, I'm not,\" said Hermione, beaming. \"I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you'll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears. \"\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something. \"There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum! \"\n\"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we'd had our conversation by the lake. And unless I'm very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She's been buzzing around for stories all year. \"\n\"When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . . \" said Ron slowly. \"He was talking to her, in his hand,\" said Hermione. \"He knew, of course. That's how she's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn't care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff\nabout us and Hagrid. \"\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass. \"I've told her I'll let her out when we get back to London,\" said Hermione. \"I've put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can't transform. And I've told her she's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can't break the habit of writing horrible lies about people. \"\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag. The door of the compartment slid open. \"Very clever. Granger,\" said Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them. \"So,\" said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \"You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal. \"\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered. \"Trying not to think about it, are we? \" said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \"Trying to pretend it hasn't happened? \"\n\"Get out,\" said Harry. He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledores speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes. \"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this! \" He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. \"Too late now. Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well - second - Diggory was the f-\"\nIt was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the floor. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so. \"Thought we'd see what those three were up to,\" said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside. \"Interesting effect,\" said George, looking down at Crabbe. \"Who used the Furnunculus Curse? \"\n\"Me,\" said Harry. \"Odd,\" said George lightly. \"I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn't be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let's not leave them here, they don't add much to the decor. \"\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle - each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit - out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut. \"Exploding Snap, anyone? \" said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards. They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them. \"You going to tell us, then? \" he said to George. \"Who you were blackmailing? \"\n\"Oh,\" said George darkly. \"That. \"\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. \"It wasn't anything important. Not now, anyway. \"\n\"We've given up,\" said George, shrugging. But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, \"All right, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo Bagman. \"\n\"Bagman? \" said Harry sharply. \"Are you saying he was involved in -\"\n\"Nah,\" said George gloomily. \"Nothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn't have the brains. \"\n\"Well, what, then? \" said Ron. Fred hesitated, then said, \"You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch? \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry and Ron slowly. \"Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he'd caught from the Irish mascots. \"\n\"So? \"\n\"So,\" said Fred impatiently, \"it vanished, didn't it? By next morning, it had gone! \"\n\"But - it must've been an accident, mustn't it? \" said Hermione. George laughed very bitterly. \"Yeah, that's what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us. \"\n\"In the end, he turned pretty nasty,\" said Fred. \"Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn't giving us anything. \"\n\"So we asked for our money back,\" said George glowering. \"He didn't refuse! \" gasped Hermione. \"Right in one,\" said Fred. \"But that was all your savings! \" said Ron. \"Tell me about it,\" said George. \"'Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan's dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He's lost everything gambling. Hasn't got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back? \"\n\"How? \" said Harry. \"He put a bet on you, mate,\" said Fred. \"Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins. \"\n\"So that's why he kept trying to help me win! \" said Harry. \"Well - I did win, didn't I? So he can pay you your gold! \"\n\"Nope,\" said George, shaking his head. \"The goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you'd win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task. \"\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again. The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King's Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put. \"Fred - George - wait a moment. \"\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings. \"Take it,\" he said, and he thrust the sack into George's hands. \"What? \" said Fred, looking flabbergasted. \"Take it,\" Harry repeated firmly. \"I don't want it. \"\n\"You're mental,\" said George, trying to push it back at Harry. \"No, I'm not,\" said Harry. \"You take it, and get inventing. It's for the joke shop. \"\n\"He is mental,\" Fred said in an almost awed voice. \"Listen,\" said Harry firmly. \"If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long. \"\n\"Harry,\" said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \"there's got to be a thousand Galleons in here. \"\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Think how many Canary Creams that is. \"\nThe twins stared at him. \"Just don't tell your mum where you got it. . . although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . . \"\n\"Harry,\" Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand. \"Look,\" he said flatly, \"take it, or I'll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they're from you. \"\nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe,\nand Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks. Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, \"I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry. \"\n\"See you. Harry,\" said Ron, clapping him on the back. \"'Bye, Harry! \" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek. \"Harry - thanks,\" George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side. Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys' car. As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he would have to meet it when it did. 5.

                "text": "'\n    Several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again and Moody growled, 'Shut up! '\n    'What? ' said Harry. 'We're not discussing anything here, it's too risky,' said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry. His magical eye remained focused on the ceiling. 'Damn it,' he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, 'it keeps getting stuck - ever since that scum wore it. '\n    And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye. 'Mad-Eye, you do know that's disgusting, don't you? ' said Tonks conversationally. 'Get me a glass of water, would you, Harry,' requested Moody. Harry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him. 'Cheers,' said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. 'I want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey. '\n    'How're we getting - wherever we're going? ' Harry asked. 'Brooms,' said Lupin. 'Only way. You're too young to Apparate, they'll be watching the Floo Network and it's more than our life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey. '\n    'Remus says you're a good flier,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice. 'He's excellent,' said Lupin, who was checking his watch. 'Anyway, you'd better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes. '\n    'I'll come and help you,' said Tonks brightly. She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest. 'Funny place,' she said. 'It's a bit too clean, d'you know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,' she added, as they entered Harry's bedroom and he turned on the light. His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he'd tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside; Hedwig's cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell; and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizards' robes that had spilled on to the floor around it. Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door. 'You know, I don't think violets really my colour,' she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. 'D'you think it makes me look a bit peaky? '\n    'Er - ' said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland. 'Yeah, it does,' said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink. 'How did you do that? ' said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again. 'I'm a Metamorphmagus,' she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. 'It means I can change my appearance at will,' she added, spotting Harry's puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. 'I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great. '\n    'You're an Auror? ' said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark-wizard-catcher was the only career he'd ever considered after Hogwarts. 'Yeah,' said Tonks, looking proud. 'Kingsley is as well, he's a bit higher up than me, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking. I'm dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs? '\n    'Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus? ' Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing. Tonks chuckled. 'Bet you wouldn't mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh? '\n    Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. 'No, I wouldn't mind,' Harry mumbled, turning away. He did rot like people staring at his scar. 'Well, you'll have to learn the hard way, I'm afraid,' said Tonks. 'Metamorphmagi are really rare, they're born, not made. Most wizards reed to use a wand, or potions, to change their appearance. But we've got to get going, Harry, we're supposed to be packing,' she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor. 'Oh - yeah,' said Harry, grabbing a few more books. 'Don't be stupid, it'll be much quicker if I - pack! ' cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor. Books, clothes, telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk. 'It's not very neat,' said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. 'My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly - she even gets the socks to fold themselves - but I've never mastered how she does it - it's a kind of flick - ' She flicked her wand hopefully. One of Harry's socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk. 'Ah, well,' said Tonks, slamming the trunk's lid shut, 'at least it's all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too. ' She pointed her wand at Hedwig's cage. 'Scourgify. ' A few feathers and droppings vanished. Well, that's a bit better - I've never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells. Right - got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! - A Firebolt? '\n    Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry's right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international-standard broomstick. 'And I'm still riding a Comet Two Sixty,' said Tonks enviously. 'Ah well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? OK, let's go. Locomotor trunk. '\n    Harry's trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a conductors baton, Tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig's cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick. Back in the kitchen Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick to look at it. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys. 'Excellent,' said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. 'We've got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we're ready. Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry - '\n    They won't,' said Harry. ' - that you're safe - '\n    That'll just depress them. '\n    - and you'll see them next summer. '\n    'Do I have to? '\n    Lupin smiled but made no answer. 'Come here, boy,' said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry towards him with his wand. 'I need to Disillusion you. '\n    'You need to what? ' said Harry nervously. 'Disillusionment Charm,' said Moody, raising his wand. 'Lupin says you've got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won't stay on while we're flying; this'll disguise you better. Here you go - '\n    He rapped him hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck. 'Nice one, Mad-Eye,' said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry's midriff. Harry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn't look anything like his any more. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon. 'Come on,' said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand. They all stepped outside on to Uncle Vernon's beautifully kept lawn. 'Clear night,' grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. 'Could've done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,' he barked at Harry, 'we're going to be flying in close formation. Tonks'll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin'll be covering you from below. I'm going to be behind you. The rest'll be circling us. We don't break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed - '\n    'Is that likely? ' Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him. ' - the others keep flying, don't stop, don't break ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they'll join you. '\n    'Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he'll think we're not taking this seriously,' said Tonks, as she strapped Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage into a harness hanging from her broom. 'I'm just telling the boy the plan,' growled Moody. 'Our job's to deliver him safely to Headquarters and if we die in the attempt - '\n    'No one's going to die,' said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice. 'Mount your brooms, that's the first signal! ' said Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky. Far, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars. Harry recognised them at once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more. 'Second signal, let's go! ' said Lupin loudly as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them. Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he'd been fantasising about all summer, he was going home . . . for a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky. 'Hard left, hard left, there's a Muggle looking up! ' shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. 'We need more height . . . give it another quarter of a mile! '\n    Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards: he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car . . . the Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition . . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy. 'Bearing south! ' shouted Mad-Eye. Town ahead! '\n    They soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spider's web of lights below. 'Bear southeast and keep climbing, there's some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in! ' called Moody. 'We're not going through clouds! ' shouted Tonks angrily, 'we'll get soaked, Mad-Eye! '\n    Harry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt's handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver. They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye's instructions. Harry's eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache; he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying, it felt like an hour at least. 'Turning southwest!"

                "text": "Everyone looked at Mrs Weasley\n    'Stay here,' she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs Blacks screeches started up again from down below. 'I'll bring up some sandwiches. '\n    She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a suck of precariously balanced cauldrons. 'Mundungus! ' said Hermione. 'What's he brought all those cauldrons for? '\n    'Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,' said Harry. 'Isn't that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons? '\n    'Yeah, you're right! ' said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. 'Blimey, Mum won't like that . . . '\n    He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening closely. Mrs Black's screaming had stopped. 'Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,' Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. 'Can't hear properly . . . d'you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears? '\n    'Might be worth it,' said George. 'I could sneak upstairs and get a pair - '\n    But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice. 'WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS! '\n    'I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,' said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs Weasley's voice to permeate the room better, 'it makes such a nice change. '\n    ' - COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE - '\n    The idiots are letting her get into her stride,' said George, shaking his head. 'You've got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she's been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry - and there goes Sirius's mum again. '\n    Mrs Weasley's voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room. Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and, though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike. The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, towards the far end of the room, all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog's. '. . . smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she's no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistress's house, oh, my poor mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they've let into her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh, the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do . . . '\n    'Hello, Kreacher,' said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap. The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise. 'Kreacher did not see young master,' he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still lacing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, 'Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is. '\n    'Sorry? ' said George. 'Didn't catch that last bit. '\n    'Kreacher said nothing,' said the elf, with a second box to George, adding in a clear undertone, 'and there its twin, unnataral little beasts they are. '\n    Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter. '. . . and there's the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my mistress knew, oh, how she'd cry, and there's a new boy, Kreacher doesn't know his name. What is he doing here? Kreacher doesn't know . . . \"\n    This is Harry, Kreacher,' said Hermione tentatively. 'Harry Potter. '\n    Kreacher's pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever. The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher's mistress saw him in such company, oh, what would she say - '\n    'Don't call her a Mudblood! ' said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily. 'It doesn't matter,' Hermione whispered, 'he's not in his tight mind, he doesn't know what he's - '\n    'Don't kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he's saying,' said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike. Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry. 'Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that's the boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it - '\n    'Don't we all, Kreacher,' said Fred. 'What do you want, anyway? ' George asked. Kreacher's huge eyes darted towards George. 'Kreacher is cleaning,' he said evasively. 'A likely story,' said a voice behind Harry. Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor. 'Stand up straight,' said Sirius impatiently. 'Now, what are you up to? '\n    'Kreacher is cleaning,' the elf repeated. 'Kreacher lives to serve lie Noble House of Black - '\n    'And it's getting blacker every day, it's filthy,' said Sirius. 'Master always liked his little joke,' said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, 'Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother's heart - '\n    'My mother didn't have a heart, Kreacher,' snapped Sirius. 'She kept herself alive out of pure spite. '\n    Kreacher bowed again as he spoke. 'Whatever Master says,' he muttered furiously. 'Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother's boots, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was - '\n    'I asked you what you were up to,' said Sirius coldly. 'Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can't throw it out. '\n    'Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,' said the elf, then muttered very fast, 'Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it - '\n    'I thought it might be that,' said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. 'She'll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don't doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher. '\n    It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room. ' - comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh, my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he's back, they say he's a murderer too - '\n    'Keep muttering and I will be a murderer! ' said Sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf. 'Sirius, he's not right in the head,' Hermione pleaded, 'I don't think he realises we can hear him. '\n    'He's been alone too long,' said Sirius, 'taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little - '\n    'If you could just set him free,' said Hermione hopefully, 'maybe - '\n    'We can't set him free, he knows too much about the Order; said Sirius curtly. 'And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it. '\n    Sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed. The tapestry looked immensely old; it was laded and looked as though Doxys had gnawed it in places. Nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black\nToujours pur'\n'You're not on here! ' said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely. 'I used to be there,' said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. 'My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home - Kreacher's quite fond of muttering the story under his breath. '\n    'You ran away from home? '\n    'When I was about sixteen,' said Sirius. 'I'd had enough. '\n    'Where did you go? ' asked Harry, staring at him. 'Your dad's place,' said Sirius. 'Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dads in the school holidays, and when I was seventeen I got a place of my own. My Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold - he's been wiped off here, too, that's probably why - anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr and Mrs Potters for Sunday lunch, though. '\n    'But . . . why did you . . . ? '\n    'Leave? ' Sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long, unkempt hair. 'Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that's him. '\n    Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name 'Regulus Black'. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth. 'He was younger than me,' said Sirius, 'and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded. '\n    'But he died,' said Harry. 'Yeah,' said Sirius. 'Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters. '\n    'You're kidding! '\n    'Come on, Harry, haven't you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were? ' said Sirius testily. 'Were - were your parents Death Eaters as well? '\n    'No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having pure-bloods in charge. They weren't alone, either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colours, who thought he had the right idea about things . . . they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first. '\n    'Was he killed by an Auror? ' Harry asked tentatively. 'Oh, no,' said Sirius. 'No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely; I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he: was being asked to do and tried to back out."

' said Fudge, with a very supercilious look on his face. 'I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story - '\n    Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again. 'We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of Dementors in that alleyway,' he said, 'other than Dudley Dursley, I mean. '\n    Fudges plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, 'We haven't got time to listen to more tarradiddles, I'm afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly - '\n    'I may be wrong,' said Dumbledore pleasantly, 'but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones? ' he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle. 'True,' said Madam Bones. 'Perfectly true. '\n    'Oh, very well, very well,' snapped Fudge. 'Where is this person? '\n    'I brought her with me,' said Dumbledore. 'She's just outside the door. Should I - ? '\n    'No - Weasley, you go,' Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, ran down the stone steps from the judge's balcony and hurried past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them. A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers. Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself. 'Full name? ' said Fudge loudly, when Mrs Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat. 'Arabella Doreen Figg,' said Mrs Figg in her quavery voice. 'And who exactly are you? ' said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice\n    'I'm a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,' said Mrs Figg. 'We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging, other than Harry Potter,' said Madam Bones at once 'That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events. '\n    'I'm a Squib,' said Mrs Figg. 'So you wouldn't have me registered, would you? '\n    'A Squib, eh? ' said Fudge, eyeing her closely. 'We'll be checking that. You'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see Dementors? ' he added, looking left and right along the bench. \"Yes, we can! ' said Mrs Figg indignantly. Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. 'Very well,' he said aloofly. 'What is your story? '\n    'I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, around about nine o'clock, on the evening of the second of August,' gabbled Mrs Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, 'when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw Dementors running - '\n    'Running? ' said Madam Bones sharply. 'Dementors don't run, they glide. '\n    'That's what I meant to say,' said Mrs Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. 'Gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys. '\n    'What did they look like? ' said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh. 'Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny - '\n    'No, no,' said Madam Bones impatiently. 'The Dementors . . . describe them. '\n    'Oh,' said Mrs Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. They were big. Big and wearing cloaks. Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs Figg might say, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a Dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground; or the rotting smell of them; or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . In the second row, a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour, a frizzy-haired witch. She smirked and nodded. 'Big and wearing cloaks,' repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. 'I see. Anything else? '\n    'Yes,' said Mrs Figg. 'I felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer's night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . . '\n    Her voice shook and died. Madam Bones's eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it. 'What did the Dementors do? ' she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope. They went for the boys,' said Mrs Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. 'One of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the Dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced only silver vapour. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first Dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased the second one away from his cousin. And that . . . that is what happened,' Mrs Figg finished, somewhat lamely. Madam Bones looked down at Mrs Figg in silence. Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally, he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, That's what you saw, is it? '\n    That is what happened,' Mrs Figg repeated. 'Very well,' said Fudge. 'You may go. '\n    Mrs Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off towards the door. Harry heard it thud shut behind her. 'Not a very convincing witness,' said Fudge loftily. 'Oh, I don't know,' said Madam Bones, in her booming voice. 'She certainly described the effects of a Dementor attack very accurately. And I can't imagine why she would say they were there if they weren't. '\n    'But Dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard? ' snorted Fudge. The odds on that must be very, very long. Even Bagman wouldn't have bet - '\n    'Oh, I don't think any of us believe the Dementors were there by coincidence,' said Dumbledore lightly. The witch sitting to the right of Fudge, with her face in shade w, moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent. 'And what is that supposed to mean? ' Fudge asked icily. 'It means that I think they were ordered there,' said Dumbledore. 'I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of Dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging! ' barked Fudge. 'Not if the Dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius. '\n    'Yes, you have,' said Fudge forcefully, 'and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The Dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to. '\n    Then,' said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, 'we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of Dementors into that alleyway on the second of August. '\n    In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forwards so that Harry saw her for the first time. He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue. The Chair recognises Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,' said Fudge. The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak. 'I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,' she said, with a simper that felt her big, round eyes as cold as ever. 'So silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy! '\n    She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused. 'If it is true that the Dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,' said Dumbledore politely. 'Of course, these particular Dementors may have been outside Ministry control - '\n    'There are no Dementors outside Ministry control! snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red. Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow. 'Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation. '\n    'It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore! ' snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud. 'Of course it isn't,' said Dumbledore mildly. 'I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated. '\n    He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly. 'I would remind everybody that the behaviour of these Dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy's imagination, is not the subject of this hearing! ' said Fudge. 'We are here to examine Harry Potter's offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery! '\n    'Of course we are,' said Dumbledore, 'but the presence of Dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch him- or herself, or any witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time of the - '\n    'We are familiar with Clause Seven, thank you very much! ' snarled Fudge. 'Of course you are,' said Dumbledore courteously. Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes? '\n    'If there were Dementors, which I doubt. '\n    'You have heard it from an eyewitness,' Dumbledore interrupted. 'If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object. '\n    'I - that - not -' blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. 'It's - I want this over with today, Dumbledore! '\n    'But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,' said Dumbledore. 'Serious miscarriage, my hat! ' said Fudge at the top of his voice. 'Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you've forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago - '\n    'That wasn't me, it was a house-elf! ' said Harry. 'YOU SEE? ' roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry's direction. 'A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you. '\n    The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,' said Dumbledore. 'I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish. '\n    'I - not - I haven't got time to listen to house-elves!"

'\n    Fred's words took a moment to penetrate Mrs Weasley's preoccupation with pyjamas. 'His . . . but . . . Ron, you're not . . . ? '\n    Ron held up his badge. Mrs Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione's. 'I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family! '\n    'What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours? ' said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son. 'Wait until your father hears! Ron, I'm so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it's the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I'm just thrilled, oh, Ronnie - '\n    Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back but Mrs Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron's neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge. 'Mum . . . don't . . . Mum, get a grip . . . ' he muttered, trying to push her away. She let go of him and said breathlessly, 'Well, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you've already got one, of course. '\n    'W-what do you mean? ' said Ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears. 'You've got to have a reward for this! ' said Mrs Weasley fondly. 'How about a nice new set of dress robes? '\n    'We've already bought him some,' said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity. 'Or a new cauldron, Charlie's old one's rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers -\n    'Mum,' said Ron hopefully, 'can I have a new broom? '\n    Mrs Weasley's face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive. 'Not a really good one! ' Ron hastened to add. 'Just - just a new one for a change , . . '\n    Mrs Weasley hesitated, then smiled. 'Of course you can . . . well, I'd better get going if I've got a broom to buy too. I'll see you all later . . . little Ronnie, a prefect! And don't forget to pack your trunks . . . a prefect . . . oh, I'm all of a dither! '\n    She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room. Fred and George exchanged looks. 'You don't mind if we don't kiss you, do you, Ron? ' said Fred in a falsely anxious voice. 'We could curtsey, if you like,' said George. 'Oh, shut up,' said Ron, scowling at them. 'Or what? ' said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. 'Going to put us in detention? '\n    'I'd love to see him try' sniggered George. 'He could if you don't watch out! ' said Hermione angrily. Fred and George burst out laughing, and Ron muttered, 'Drop it, Hermione. '\n    'We're going to have to watch our step, George,' said Fred, pretending to tremble, 'with these two on our case . . . '\n    'Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,' said Cieorge, shaking his head. And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated. 'Those two! ' said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs. 'Don't pay any attention to them, Ron, they're only jealous! '\n    'I don't think they are,' said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. They've always said only prats become prefects . . . still,' he added on a happier note, 'they've never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose . . . she'll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there's the new Cleansweep out, that'd be great . . . yeah, I think I'll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows . . . '\n    He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. For some reason, Harry found he did not want to look at Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs Weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk. 'Harry? ' said Hermione tentatively. 'Well done, Hermione,' said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and, still not looking at her, 'brilliant. Prefect. Great. '\n    'Thanks,' said Hermione. 'Erm - Harry - could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They'll be really pleased - I mean prefect is something they can understand. '\n    'Yeah, no problem,' said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. Take her! '\n    He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings. He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione had left and Hedwig had gone. Harry hurried across the room, closed the door, then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe. He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought about it . . . what would he have expected? Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head. Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron? No, said the small voice defiantly. Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings. I'm better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I'm not better at anything else. That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron and Hermione had had together since starting at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion? Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harry's head. Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn't fight Quirrell with me. They didn't take on Riddle and the Basilisk. They didn't get rid of all those Dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren't in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned . . . And the same feeling of ill-usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again. I've definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I've done more than either of them! But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn't choose prefects because they've got themselves into a load of dangerous situations . . . maybe he chooses them for other reasons . . . Ron must have something you don't . . . Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe's clawed feet, remembering what. Fred had said: 'No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . . '\n    Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with himself. Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was not Ron's fault. Was he, Harry, Ron's best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn't, have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron's back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something? At this point Harry heard Ron's footsteps on the stairs again. He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin on to his face as Ron bounded back through the door. 'Just caught her! ' he said happily. 'She says she'll get the Cleansweep if she can. '\n    'Cool,' Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty. 'Listen - Ron - well done, mate. '\n    The smile faded off Ron's face. 'I never thought it would be me! ' he said, shaking his head. 'I thought it would be you! '\n    'Nah, I've caused too much trouble,' Harry said, echoing Fred. 'Yeah,' said Ron, 'yeah, I suppose . . . well, we'd better get our trunks packed, hadn't we? '\n    It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Marry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect's badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk. Mrs Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o'clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing. 'Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,' she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face. Down in the basement Mrs Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read:\nCONGRATULATIONS\nRON AND HERMIONE\nNEW PREFECTS\nShe looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday. 'I thought we'd have a little party not a sit-down dinner,' she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George and Ginny as they entered the room. 'Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron. I've sent them both owls and they're thrilled,' she added, beaming. Fred rolled his eyes. Sirius, Lupin, Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already\n    there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a Butterbeer. 'Oh, Alastor, I am glad you're here,' said Mrs Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his travelling cloak. 'We've been wanting to ask you for ages - could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what's inside it? We haven't wanted to open it. just in case it's something really nasty. '\n    'No problem, Molly . . . '\n    Moody's electric-blue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen. Drawing room . . . ' he growled, as the pupil contracted. 'Desk in the corner? Yeah, I see it . . . yeah, it's a Boggart . . . want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly? '\n    No, no, I'll do it myself later,' beamed Mrs Weasley, 'you have your drink. We're having a little bit of a celebration, actually . . . ' She gestured at the scarlet banner. 'Fourth prefect in the family! ' she said fondly, ruffling Ron's hair. 'Prefect, eh? ' growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards Sirius and Lupin. 'Well, congratulations,' said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, 'authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn't have appointed you . . . '\n    Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody's travelling cloak. 'Well, I think a toast is in order,' said Mr Weasley, when everyone had a drink. He raised his goblet. To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects! '\n    Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them, and then applauded."

Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room,\nfor simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs. (We regret that all work is undertaken at applicant's own risk. )\n'They are the limit,' said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend, which was to be in October. 'We'll have to talk to them, Ron. '\n    Ron looked positively alarmed. 'Why? '\n    'Because we're prefects! ' said Hermione, as they climbed out through the portrait hole. 'It's up to us to stop this kind of thing! '\n    Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting. 'Anyway, what's up, Harry? ' Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. 'You look really angry about something. '\n    'Seamus reckons Harry's lying about You-Know-Who,' said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond. Hermione, who Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed. 'Yes, Lavender thinks so too,' she said gloomily. 'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you? ' Harry said loudly. 'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side. '\n    There was a short pause. 'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice. That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast? '\n    Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly and Hermione sighed again. 'About You-Know-Who. He said his \"gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust - \" '\n    'How do you remember stuff like that? ' asked Ron, looking at her in admiration. 'I listen, Ron,' said Hermione, with a touch of asperity. 'So do I, but I still couldn't tell you exactly what - '\n    The point,' Hermione pressed on loudly, 'is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who's only been back two months and we've already started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat's warning was the same: stand together, be united - '\n    'And Harry got it right last night,' retorted Ron. 'If that means we're supposed to get matey with the Slytherins - fat chance. '\n    'Well, I think it's a pity we're not trying for a bit of inter-house unity,' said Hermione crossly. They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the Entrance Hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers. 'Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,' said Harry sarcastically. They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry's mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud grey. 'Dumbledore didn't even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman's staying,' he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table. 'Maybe . . . ' said Hermione thoughtfully. 'What? ' said both Harry and Ron together. 'Well . . . maybe he didn't want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here. '\n    'What d'you mean, draw attention to it? ' said Ron, half-laughing. 'How could we not notice? '\n    Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to Harry. 'Hi, Angelina. '\n    'Hi,' she said briskly, 'good summer? ' And without waiting for an answer, 'Listen, I've been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain. '\n    'Nice one,' said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina's pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood's had been, which could only be an improvement. 'Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver's left. Tryouts are on Friday at five o'clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new person'll fit in. '\n    'OK,' said Harry. Angelina smiled at him and departed. 'I'd forgotten Wood had left,' said Hermione vaguely as she sat down beside Ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her. 'I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team? '\n    'I s'pose,' said Harry, taking the bench opposite. 'He was a good Keeper . . . '\n    'Still, it won't hurt to have some new blood, will it? ' said Ron. With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak. What are you still getting that for? ' said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl's leg and it took off again. 'I'm not bothering . . . load of rubbish. '\n    'It's best to know what the enemy is saying,' said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating. 'Nothing,' she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate. 'Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything. '\n    Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables. 'Look at today! ' groaned Ron. 'History of Magic, double Potions,\n    Divination and double Defence Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George'd hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . . \"\n    'Do mine ears deceive me? ' said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing on to the bench beside Harry. 'Hogwarts prefects surely don't wish to skive off lessons? '\n    'Look what we've got today,' said Ron grumpily, shoving his timetable under Fred's nose. 'That's the worst Monday I've ever seen. '\n    'Fair point, little bro,' said Fred, scanning the column. 'You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like. '\n    'Why's it cheap? ' said Ron suspiciously. 'Because you'll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven't got an antidote yet,' said George, helping himself to a kipper. 'Cheers,' said Ron moodily, pocketing his timetable, 'but I think I'll take the lessons. '\n    'And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,' said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, 'you can't advertise for testers on the Gryffindor noticeboard. '\n    'Says who? ' said George, looking astonished. 'Says me,' said Hermione. 'And Ron. '\n    'Leave me out of it,' said Ron hastily. Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered. 'You'll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,' said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. 'You're starting your fifth year, you'll be begging us for a Snackbox before long. '\n    'And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox? ' asked Hermione. 'Fifth year's OWL year,' said George. 'So? '\n    'So you've got your exams coming up, haven't you? They'll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they'll be rubbed raw,' said Fred with satisfaction. 'Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to OWLs,' said George happily. Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint . . . '\n    'Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d'you remember? ' said Fred remmiscently. That's 'cause you put Bulbadox powder in his pyjamas,' said George. 'Oh yeah,' said Fred, grinning. 'I'd forgotten . . . hard to keep track sometimes, isn't it? '\n    'Anyway, it's a nightmare of a year, the fifth,' said George. 'If you care about exam results, anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our peckers up somehow. '\n    'Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three OWLs each? ' said Ron. 'Yep,' said Fred unconcernedly. 'But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement. '\n    'We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,' said George brightly, 'now that we've got-\n    He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them. ' - now that we've got our OWLs,' George said hastily. 'I mean, do we really need NEWTs? But we didn't think Mum could take us leaving school early not on top of Percy turning out to be the world's biggest prat. '\n    We're not going to waste our last year here, though,' said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. 'We're going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from a joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, then produce products to fit the demand. '\n    'But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop? ' Hermione asked sceptically. 'You're going to need all the ingredients and materials - and premises too, I suppose . . . '\n    Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, 'Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies, Hermione. C'mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology. '\n    Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast. 'What did that mean? ' said Hermione, looking from Harry to F. on. ' \"Ask us no questions . . . \" Does that mean they've already got some gold to start a joke shop? '\n    'You know, I've been wondering about that,' said Ron, his brow furrowed. 'They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and I couldn't understand where they got the Galleons . . . '\n    Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters. 'D'you reckon it's true this year's going to be really tough? Because of the exams? '\n    'Oh, yeah,' said Ron. 'Bound to be, isn't it? OWLs are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice, too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what NEWTs you want to do next year. '\n    'D'you know what you want to do after Hogwarts? ' Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their History of Magic classroom. 'Not really,' said Ron slowly. 'Except . . . well . . . '\n    He looked slightly sheepish. What? ' Harry urged him. Well, it'd be cool to be an Auror,' said Ron in an off-hand voice. 'Yeah, it would,' said Harry fervently. 'But they're, like, the elite,' said Ron. 'You've got to be really good. What about you, Hermione? '\n    'I don't know,' she said. 'I think I'd like to do something really worthwhile. '\n    'An Aurors worthwhile! ' said Harry. 'Yes, it is, but it's not the only worthwhile thing,' said Hermione thoughtfully, 'I mean, if I could take SPEW further . . ."

'Dean Thomas. '\n    'Well, Mr Thomas? '\n    'Well, it's like Harry said, isn't it? ' said Dean. 'If we're going to be attacked, it won't be risk free. '\n    'I repeat,' said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, 'do you expect to be attacked during my classes? '\n    'No, but - '\n    Professor Umbridge talked over him. 'I do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school,' she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, 'but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed - not to mention,' she gave a nasty little laugh, 'extremely dangerous half-breeds. '\n    'If you mean Professor Lupin,' piped up Dean angrily, 'he was the best we ever -\n    'Hand, Mr Thomas! As I was saying - you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day - '\n    'No we haven't,' Hermione said, 'we just - '\n    'Your hand is not up, Miss Granger! '\n    Hermione put up her hand. Professor Umbridge turned away from her. 'It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you. '\n    'Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn't he? ' said Dean hotly. 'Mind you, we still learned loads. '\n    'Your hand is not up, Mr Thomas! ' trilled Professor Umbridge. 'Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is? ' she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up. 'Parvati Patil, and isn't there a practical bit in our Defence Against\n    the Dark Arts OWL? Aren't we supposed to show that we can actually do the counter-curses and things? '\n    As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,' said Professor Umbridge dismissively. 'Without ever practising them beforehand? ' said Parvati incredulously. Are you telling us that the first time we'll get to do the spells will be during our exam? '\n    'I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough - '\n    And what good's theory going to be in the real world? ' said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again. Professor Umbridge looked up. 'This is school, Mr Potter, not the real world,' she said softly. 'So we're not supposed to be prepared for what's waiting for us out there? '\n    'There is nothing waiting out there, Mr Potter. '\n    'Oh, yeah? ' said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point. 'Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves? ' enquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice. 'Hmm, let's think . . . ' said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice. 'Maybe . . . Lord Voldemort? '\n    Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face. 'Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr Potter. '\n    The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry. 'Now, let me make a few things quite plain. '\n    Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned towards them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk. 'You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead - '\n    'He wasn't dead,' said Harry angrily, 'but yeah, he's returned! '\n    'Mr-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,' said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him. 'As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie. '\n    'It is NOT a lie! ' said Harry. 'I saw him, I fought him! '\n    'Detention, Mr Potter! ' said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. Tomorrow evening. Five o'clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, \"Basics for Beginners\". '\n    Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated. 'Harry, no! ' Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach. 'So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he? ' Harry asked, his voice shaking. There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night Cedric had died. They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face. 'Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident,' she said coldly. 'It was murder,' said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had hardly spoken to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. 'Voldemort killed him and you know it. '\n    Professor Umbridge's face was quite blank. For a moment, Harry thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, 'Come here, Mr Potter, dear. '\n    He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher's desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next. Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it. Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,' said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him. He took it from her without saying a word, turned on his heel and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, slamming the classroom door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the poltergeist, a wide-mouthed little man floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells. 'Why, it's Potty Wee Potter! ' cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl. 'Get out of it, Peeves. '\n    'Oooh, Crackpot's feeling cranky,' said Peeves, pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. 'What is; it this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in - ' Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry '- tongues? '\n    'I said, leave me ALONE! ' Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him. 'Oh, most think he's barking, the potty wee lad,\nBut some are more kindly and think he's just sad,\nBut Peevesy knows better and says that he's mad - '\n'SHUT UP! '\n    A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed. 'What on earth are you shouting about, Potter? ' she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. 'Why aren't you in class? '\n    'I've been sent to see you,' said Harry stiffly. 'Sent? What do you mean, sent? '\n    He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower. 'Come in here, Potter. '\n    He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically behind him. 'Well? ' said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. \"Is this true? '\n    'Is what true? ' Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended. 'Professor? ' he added, in an attempt to sound more polite. 'Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge? '\n    'Yes,' said Harry. 'You called her a liar? '\n    'Yes. '\n    'You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back? '\n    'Yes. '\n    Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, watching Harry closely. Then she said, 'Have a biscuit, Potter. '\n    'Have - what? '\n    'Have a biscuit,' she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. 'And sit down. '\n    There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion. Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge's note and looked very seriously at Harry. 'Potter, you need to be careful. '\n    Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual. 'Misbehaviour in Dolores Umbridge's class could cost you much more than house points and a detention. '\n    'What do you - ? '\n    'Potter, use your common sense,' snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her usual manner. 'You know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting. '\n    The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move. 'It says here she's given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,' Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge's note again. 'Every evening this week! ' Harry repeated, horrified. 'But, Professor, couldn't you - ? '\n    'No, I couldn't,' said Professor McGonagall flatly. 'But - '\n    'She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o'clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge. '\n    'But I was telling the truth! ' said Harry, outraged. 'Voldemort is back, you know he is; Professor Dumbledore knows he is - '\n    'For heaven's sake, Potter! ' said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort's name). 'Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It's about keeping your head down and your temper under control! '\n    She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and Harry stood up, too. 'Have another biscuit,' she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him. 'No, thanks,' said Harry coldly. 'Don't be ridiculous,' she snapped. He took one. Thanks,' he said grudgingly. 'Didn't you listen to Dolores Umbridge's speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter? '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry. 'Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohibited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts."

Listen, you can help me if you like, it's quite fun, I'm getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.

'Er - not tomorrow. I've got loads of homework to do . . . '\n    And he traipsed off to the boys' stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed. - CHAPTER FOURTEEN -\nPercy and Padfoot\nHarry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his four-poster's hangings, and savoured the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson. Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room. Making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione's elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard . . . but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say. He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have? He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment. Dear Snuffles,\nHope you're OK, the first week back here's been terrible, I'm really glad it's the weekend. We've got a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She's nearly as nice as your mum. I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge. We're all missing our biggest friend, we hope he'll be back soon. Please write back quickly. Best,\n    Harry\nHarry reread the letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about - or who he was talking to - just from reading this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back. Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts. Considering it was a very short letter, it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully, he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery. 'I would not go that way if I were you,' said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of Harry as he walked down the passage. 'Peeves is planning an amusing . joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor. '\n    'Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the persons head? ' asked Harry. 'Funnily enough, it does,' said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. 'Subtlety has never been Peeves's strong point. I'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron . . . he might be able to put a stop to it . . . see you, Harry . . . '\n    'Yeah, bye,' said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last. Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker's skeletal grey cat, Mrs Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful. 'I'm not doing anything wrong,' Harry called after her. She had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning. The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early-morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig. There you are,' he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. 'Get down here, I've got a letter for you. '\n    With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder. 'Right, I know this says Snuffles on the outside,' he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, 'but it's for Sirius, OK? '\n    She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood. 'Safe flight, then,' said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moments pressure on his arm, Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid's hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn. The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savouring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later . . . then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged hcrse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leahery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl's, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle, then plunged back into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly, Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly. The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock and, turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands. 'Hi,' said Harry automatically. 'Oh . . . hi,' she said breathlessly. 'I didn't think anyone would be up here this early . . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it's my mum's birthday'\n    She held up the parcel. Right,' said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind. Nice day,' he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the weather . . . 'Yeah,' said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. 'Good Quidditch conditions. I haven't been out all week, have you? '\n    'No,' said Harry. Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel. 'Hey has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet? ' she asked. 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'It's my friend Ron Weasley, d'you know him? '\n    'The Tornados-hater? ' said Cho rather coolly. 'Is he any good? '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, 'I think so. I didn't see his tryout, though, I was in detention. '\n    Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owls legs. That Umbridge woman's foul,' she said in a low voice. 'Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how - how - how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. You were really brave standing up to her like that. '\n    Harry's insides re-inflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse; Cho thought he had been really brave. For a moment, he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl . . . but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again. Filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled; he had obviously run here. Mrs Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion. 'Aha! ' said Filch, taking a flat-footed step towards Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. Tve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs! '\n    Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker. 'Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs? '\n    Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it. 'I have my sources."

                "text": "'\n    When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade. '\n    'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius. 'Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly. 'You've got enough on your plate without Sirius, too. '\n    She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks. The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all. When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day. 'Er - why was Filch sniffing you? ' asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at: a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates. 'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh. T forgot to tell you . . . '\n    And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself. 'He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off? '\n    'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging. 'Maybe Malfoy he'd think it was a laugh. '\n    They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes. 'Malfoy? ' said Hermione, sceptically. 'Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . . '\n    And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade. 'Where are we going, anyway? ' Harry asked. The Three Broomsticks? '\n    'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard. '\n    They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door. 'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside. It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog's Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries. Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: 'Yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head,' he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon's egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly. 'I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. 'Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that? '\n    Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure. 'Umbridge is shorter than that woman,' she said quietly. 'And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules. We're not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed. I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing. '\n    'No,' said Harry drily, 'especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it? '\n    The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry. What? he grunted. 'Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione. The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar. 'Six Sickles,' he said. 'I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman's eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman. 'You know what? ' Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. 'We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn't care. I've always wanted to try Firewhisky - '\n    'You - are - a - prefect,' snarled Hermione. 'Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face. 'Yeah . . . '\n    'So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us? ' Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig. 'Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. 'I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now. '\n    The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people. First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise. 'A couple of people? ' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people? '\n    'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs? '\n    The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full. 'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have . . . twenty-five Butterbeers, please? '\n    The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar. 'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these . . . '\n    Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione. 'What have you been telling people? ' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting? '\n    'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first. '\n    'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him. Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all. In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry. 'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi. '\n    The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry. 'Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands. '\n    She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, 'And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells - '\n    'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet? ' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely. 'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once. 'But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because . . . because . . . ' she took a great breath and finished, 'because Lord Voldemort is back. '\n    The reaction was immediate and predictable. Clio's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry. Well . . ."

                "text": "These will be good when we're practising Stunning,' said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot. 'And just look at these books! ' said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. 'A Compendium of Common Curses and their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . . ' She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. 'Harry, this is wonderful, there's everything we need here! '\n    And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read. There was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked round. Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati and Dean had arrived. 'Whoa,' said Dean, staring around, impressed. 'What is this place? '\n    Harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside. 'Well,' said Harry, slightly nervously. This is the place we've found for practice sessions, and you've - er - obviously found it OK. '\n    'It's fantastic! ' said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement. 'It's bizarre,' said Fred, frowning around at it. 'We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then. '\n    'Hey, Harry, what's this stuff? ' asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass. 'Dark detectors,' said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. 'Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don't want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled\n    He gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognisable. He turned his back on it. 'Well, I've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er - ' He noticed a raised hand. 'What, Hermione? '\n    'I think we ought to elect a leader,' said Hermione. 'Harry's leader,' said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad. Harry's stomach did yet another back-flip. 'Yes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,' said Hermione, unperturbed. 'It makes it formal and it gives him authority. So - 'everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader? '\n    Everybody put up their hand, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very half-heartedly. 'Er - right, thanks,' said Harry, who could feel his face burning. 'And - what, Hermione? '\n    'I also think we ought to have a name,' she said brightly, her hand still in the air. 'It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think? '\n    'Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League? ' said Angelina hopefully. 'Or the Ministry of Magic are Morons Group? ' suggested Fred. 'I was thinking,' said Hermione, frowning at Fred, 'more of a name that didn't tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings. '\n    The Defence Association? ' said Cho. 'The DA for short, so nobody knows what we're talking about? '\n    'Yeah, the DA's good,' said Ginny. 'Only let's make it stand for Dumbledore's Army, because that's the Ministry's worst fear, isn't it? '\n    There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this. 'All in favour of the DA? ' said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. That's a majority - motion passed! '\n    She pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters:\nDUMBLEDORE'S ARMY\n'Right,' said Harry, when she had sat down again, 'shall we get practising then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it's pretty basic but I've found it really useful - '\n    'Oh, please,' said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. 'I don't think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you? '\n    'I've used it against him,' said Harry quietly. 'It saved my life in June. '\n    Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet. 'But if you think it's beneath you, you can leave,' Harry said. Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else. 'OK,' said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him, 'I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise. '\n    It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless. You can practise with me,' Harry told him. 'Right - on the count of three, then - one, two, three - '\n    The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus. Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them. 'Expelliarmus! said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, tell his wand fly out of his hand. 'I DID IT! ' said Neville gleefully. 'I've never done it before - I DID IT! '\n    'Good one! ' said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. 'Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing? '\n    Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back. 'Sorry Harry,' said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. 'Couldn't resist. '\n    Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end. 'OK, stop! ' Harry shouted. 'Stop. ' STOP! '\n    I need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands. That wasn't bad,' said Harry, 'but there's definite room for improvement. ' Zacharias Smith glared at him. 'Let's try again. '\n    He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions. Slowly, the general performance improved. He: avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer. 'Oh no,' said Cho rather wildly as he approached. 'Expelliarmious! I mean, Expellimellius! I - oh, sorry, Marietta! '\n    Her curly-haired friend's sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault. 'You made me nervous, I was doing all right before then! ' Cho told Harry ruefully. That was quite good,' Harry lied, but when she raised her eyebrows he said, 'Well, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there. '\n    She laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away. 'Don't mind her,' Cho muttered. 'She doesn't really want to be here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge. You see - her mum works for the Ministry. '\n    What about your parents? ' asked Harry. Well, they've forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge, too,' said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. 'But if they think I'm not going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric - '\n    She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot's wand went whizzing past Harry's ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose. Well, my dad is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action! ' said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch - 'Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head. 'He's always saying he'd believe anything of Fudge; I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there's his Umgubular Slashkilter - '\n    'Don't ask,' Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled. 'Hey, Harry,' Hermione called from the other end of the room, 'have you checked the time? '\n    He looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out of bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody stopped shouting 'Expelliarmus' and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor. 'Well, that was pretty good,' said Harry, 'but we've overrun, we'd better leave it here. Same time, same place next week? '\n    'Sooner! ' said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement. Angelina, however, said quickly, The Quidditch season's about to start, we need team practices too! '\n    'Let's say next Wednesday night, then,' said Harry, 'we can decide on additional meetings then. Come on, we'd better get going. '\n    He pulled out the Marauder's Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens; the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the Fat Lady's portrait. That was really, really good, Harry,' said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry and Ron who were left. 'Yeah, it was! ' said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. 'Did you see me disarm Hermione, Harry? '\n    'Only once,' said Hermione, stung. 'I got you loads more than you got me -'\n    'I did not only get you once, I got you at least three times - '\n    'Well, if you're counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand - '\n    They argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder's Map, but he was also thinking of Cho saying he made her nervous."

                "text": "He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder. 'We're workin' in here today! ' Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him. 'Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark. '\n    'What prefers the dark? ' Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. 'What did he say prefers the dark - did you hear? '\n    Harry remembered the only other occasion on which Malfoy had entered the Forest before now; he had not been very brave then, either. He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him. 'Ready? ' said Hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. 'Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train 'em. '\n    'And you're sure they're trained, are you? ' said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced. 'Only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it? '\n    The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too. 'Course they're trained,' said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder. 'So what happened to your face, then? ' demanded Malfoy. 'Mind yer own business! ' said Hagrid, angrily. 'Now, if yeh've finished askin' stupid questions, follow me! '\n    He turned and strode straight into the Forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class. They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. With a grunt, Hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment. 'Gather roun', gather roun',' Hagrid encouraged. 'Now, they'll be attracted by the smell o the meat but I'm going ter give em a call anyway, 'cause they'll like ter know it's me. '\n    He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed: most of them looked too scared to make a sound. Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third lime and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees. A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs. A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, 'Why doesn't Hagrid call again? '\n    Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail. 'Oh, an' here comes another one! ' said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery-wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. 'Now . . . put yer hands up, who can see 'em? '\n    Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him. 'Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you'd be able ter, Harry,' he said seriously. 'An' you too, Neville, eh? An' - '\n    'Excuse me,' said Malfoy in a sneering voice, 'but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing? '\n    For an answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed. 'What's doing it? ' Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. 'What's eating it? '\n    Thestrals,' said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft 'Oh! ' of comprehension at Harry's shoulder. 'Hogwarts has got a whole herd of 'em in here. Now, who knows - ? '\n    'But they're really, really unlucky! ' interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed. They're supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once - '\n    'No, no, no,' said Hagrid, chuckling, 'tha's jus' superstition, that is, they aren' unlucky, they're dead clever an' useful! Course, this lot don' get a lot o' work, it's mainly jus' pullin' the school carriages unless Dumbledore's takin' a long journey an' don' want ter Apparate - an' here's another couple, look - '\n    Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, 'I think I felt something, I think it's near me! '\n    'Don' worry, it won' hurt yeh,' said Hagrid patiently. 'Righ', now, who can tell me why some o' yeh can see 'em an' some can't? '\n    Hermione raised her hand. 'Go on then,' said Hagrid, beaming at her. The only people who can see Thestrals,' she said, 'are people who have seen death. '\n    Tha's exactly right,' said Hagrid solemnly, 'ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, Thestrals - '\n    'Hem, hem. '\n    Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at the ready. Hagrid. who had never heard Umbridge's fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest Thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound. 'Hem, hem. '\n    'Oh, hello! ' Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise. 'You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning? ' said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, as though she were addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson? '\n    'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid brightly. 'Glad yeh found the place all righ'! Well, as you can see - or, I dunno - can you? We're doin' Thestrals today - '\n    'I'm sorry? ' said Professor Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her ear and frowning. 'What did you say? '\n    Hagrid looked a little confused. 'Er - Thestrals! ' he said loudly. 'Big - er - winged horses, yeh know! '\n    He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard: 'Has . . . to . . . resort . . . to . . . crude . . . sign . . . language. '\n    'Well . . . anyway . . . ' said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered, 'erm . . . what was I sayin? '\n    'Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory,' muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage. 'Oh, yeah,' said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge's clipboard, but ploughing on valiantly. 'Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an' five females. This one,' he patted the first horse to have appeared, 'name o' Tenebrus, he's my special favourite, firs' one born here in the Forest - '\n    'Are you aware,' Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, 'that the Ministry of Magic has classified Thestrals as \"dangerous\"? '\n    Harry's heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled. Thestrals aren' dangerous! All righ', they might take a bite outta yeh if yeh really annoy them - '\n    'Shows . . . signs . . . of. . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of. . . violence,' muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again. 'No - come on! ' said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. 'I mean, a dog'll bite if yeh bait it, won' it - but Thestrals have jus' got a bad reputation because o' the death thing - people used ter think they were bad omens, didn' they? Jus' didn' understand, did they? '\n    Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, 'Please continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk,' she mimed walking (Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter) 'among the students' (she pointed around at individual members of the class) 'and ask them questions. ' She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking. Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now. 'You hag, you evil hag! ' she whispered, as Umbridge walked towards Pansy Parkinson. 'I know what you're doing, you awiul, twisted, vicious - '\n    'Erm . . . anyway,' said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, 'so - Thestrals. Yeah. Well, there's loads o' good stuff abou' them . . . '\n    'Do you find,' said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, 'that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks? '\n    Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles. 'No . . . because . . . well . . . it sounds . . . like grunting a lot of the time . . . '\n    Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrid's face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy's answer. 'Er . . . yeah . . . good stuff abou' Thestrals. Well, once they're tamed, like this lot, yeh'll never be lost again. 'Mazin' sense o' direction, jus' tell 'em where yeh want ter go - '\n    'Assuming they can understand you, of course,' said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville. 'You can see the Thestrals, Longbottom, can you? ' she said. Neville nodded. 'Who did you see die? ' she asked, her tone indifferent. 'My . . . my grandad,' said Neville. 'And what do you think of them?"

                "text": "He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him. He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else. The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore . . . if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all. *\nEverybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her. Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later. 'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you. '\n    'What are you doing here? ' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad? '\n    'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas. ' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches. '\n    Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed. 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . . '\n    She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry. 'How're you feeling? ' asked Hermione. 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly. 'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's. '\n    They do, do they? ' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed. 'Well, you have! ' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us! '\n    'It's you lot who won't look at me! ' said Harry angrily. 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching. 'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away. 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\n    'Yeah? ' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it. '\n    'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\n    'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled. 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels. '\n    Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round. 'I forgot,' he said. 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly. Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then? '\n    'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing? ' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to? '\n    Harry racked his brains. 'No,' he said. Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there. '\n    Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself. 'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\n    'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year. '\n    This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ? '\n    'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry. '\n    'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up. '\n    Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\n    Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice. *\nHow could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards. Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile. 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\n    Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay! '\n    Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed. 'Merry Christmas,' said George. 'Don't go downstairs for a bit. '\n    'Why not? ' said Ron. 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily. 'Percy sent back his Christmas jumper. '\n    'Without a note,' added George. 'Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything. '\n    'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings. '\n    'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. 'So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon. '\n    'What's that supposed to be, anyway? ' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. 'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes. '\n    'It's Harry! ' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back! '\n    'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the \"i\"s and crossed the \"t\"s then you may do whatever you please! '\n    They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling 'Merry Christmas' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione. Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily. 'I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume's really unusual, Ron. '\n    'No problem,' said Ron. 'Who's that for, anyway? ' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying. 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly. 'It had better not be clothes! ' Ron warned her. 'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free! '\n    'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom. '\n    'What bedroom? ' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother. 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione. 'Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen. '\n    Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them 'Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes. 'So, is this Kreacher's bedroom? ' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open. 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. 'Er . . . I think we'd better knock. '\n    Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply. 'He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. 'Urgh! '\n    Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest."

                "text": "A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreachers favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape. 'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. 'He'll find it later, that'll be fine. '\n    'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately? '\n    'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry. 'You were ordering him out of the kitchen. '\n    'Yeah . . . ' said Sirius, frowning. 'You know, I think that's the last time I saw him, too . . . he must be hiding upstairs somewhere. '\n    'He couldn't have left, could he? ' said Harry. 'I mean, when you said \"out\", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house? '\n    'No, no, house-elves can't leave unless they're given clothes. They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius. They can leave the house if they really want to,' Harry contradicted him. 'Dobby did, he left the Malfoy's' to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it. '\n    Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, 'I'll look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died . . . but I mustn't get my hopes up. '\n    Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful. Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry a:id Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to 'borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace. The journey to St Mungo's was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass. The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St Mungo's had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril. 'Family argument, eh? ' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. 'You're the third I've seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor. '\n    They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face. 'Everything all right, Arthur? ' asked Mrs Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents. 'Fine, fine,' said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. 'You - er - 'haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you? '\n    'No,' said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, 'why? '\n    'Nothing, nothing,' said Mr Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. 'Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful! ' For he had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasley's answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt. 'Arthur,' she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, 'you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow. '\n    'What? ' said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. 'No, no - it's nothing - it's - 'I - '\n    He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley's piercing gaze. Well - now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea . . . he's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - '\n    Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something s. bout getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning. 'Do you mean to tell me,' said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, 'that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies? '\n    'Not messing about, Molly, dear,' said Mr Weasley imploringly, 'it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - '\n    'Meaning? '\n    'Well . . . well, I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are? '\n    'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '\n    'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet. Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs Weasley shriek, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA? '\n    'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. 'Stitches . . . I ask you . . . '\n    'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly. 'I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is? '\n    'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk. They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit. 'And what's that supposed to be? ' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way. ' 'Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now - '\n    'Watch who you're calling gruesome! ' said Ron, his ears turning red. ' - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes - '\n    'I have not got spattergroit! '\n    'But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master - '\n    'They're freckles! ' said Ron furiously. 'Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone! '\n    He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces. 'What floor's this? '\n    'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione. 'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -\n    But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth. 'Blimey! ' said Ron, also staring at the man. 'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. 'Professor Lockhart. '\n    Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown. 'Well, hello there! ' he said. 'I expect you'd like my autograph, would you? '\n    'Hasn't changed much, has he? ' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned. 'Er - how are you, Professor? ' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St Mungo's in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited. 'I'm very well indeed, thank you! ' said Lockhart exuberantly, palling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. 'Mow, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know! '\n    'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn't you be in a ward? '\n    The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, 'Haven't we met? '\n    'Er . . . yeah, we have,' said Harry. 'You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember? '\n    Teach? ' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. 'Me? Did I? '\n    And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming. Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out! '\n    But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, 'Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to? '\n    A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others. 'Oh, Gilderoy, you've got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, he's such a sweetie, aren't you? '\n    'We're doing autographs! ' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. They want loads of them, won't take no for an answer! I just hope we've got enough photographs! '\n    'Listen to him,' said the Healer, taking Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old."

                "text": "He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them, the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville. Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during the DA meetings. Harry's sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving. On the contrary, Harry felt he was getting \\vorse with every lesson. Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort's thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort's mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door. 'Maybe it's a bit like an illness,' said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. 'A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better. '\n    The lessons with Snape are making it worse,' said Harry flatly 'I'm getting sick of my scar hurting and I'm getting bored with walking down that corridor every night. ' He rubbed his forehead angrily. 'I just wish the door would open, I'm sick of standing staring at it - '\n    That's not funny,' said Hermione sharply. 'Dumbledore doesn't want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn't have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You're just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons. '\n    'I am working! ' said Harry, nettled. \"You try it some time - Snape: trying to get inside your head - it's not a bundle of laughs, you know! '\n    'Maybe . . . ' said Ron slowly. 'Maybe what? ' said Hermione, rather snappishly. 'Maybe it's not Harry's fault he can't close his mind,' said Ron darkly. 'What do you mean? ' said Hermione. 'Well, maybe Snape isn't really trying to help Harry . . . '\n    Harry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other. 'Maybe,' he said again, in a lower voice, 'he's actually trying to open Harry's mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know-\n    'Shut up, Ron,' said Hermione angrily. 'How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough. '\n    'He used to be a Death Eater,' said Ron stubbornly. 'And we've never seen proof that he really swapped sides. '\n    'Dumbledore trusts him,' Hermione repeated. 'And if we can't trust Dumbledore, we can't trust anyone. '\n*\nWith so much to worry about and so much to do - startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth-years working until past midnight, secret DA sessions and regular classes with Snape - 'January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine's Day spent entirely in her company. On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls, Hedwig was not there - not that Harry had expected her - but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down. 'And about time! If it hadn't come today . . . ' she said, eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face. 'Listen, Harry,' she said, looking up at him, 'this is really important. Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday? '\n    'Well . . . I dunno,' said Harry uncertainly. 'Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do. '\n    Well, bring her along if you must,' said Hermione urgently. 'But will you come? '\n    'Well . . . all right, but why? '\n    'I haven't got time to tell you now, I've got to answer this quickly. '\n    And she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other. 'Are you coming? ' Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, looking glum. 'I can't come into Hogsmeade at all; Angelina wants a full day's training. Like it's going to help; we're the worst team I've ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, they're pathetic, even worse than I am. ' He heaved a great sigh. 'I dunno why Angelina won't just let me resign. '\n    It's because you're good when you're on form, that's why,' said Harry irritably. He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron's plight, when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to have noticed Harry's tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the Entrance Hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about. She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long pony-tail. Harry's feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides. 'Hi,' said Cho slightly breathlessly. 'Hi,' said Harry. They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, 'Well - er - shall we go, then? '\n    'Oh - yes . . . '\n    They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each others eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of a day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and\n    Ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. 'You really miss it, don't you? ' said Cho. He looked round and saw her watching him. 'Yeah,' sighed Harry. 'I do. '\n    'Remember the first time we played against each other, in the third year? ' she asked him. 'Yeah,' said Harry, grinning. 'You kept blocking me. '\n    'And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,' said Cho, smiling reminiscently. 'I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right? '\n    'Nah, it was Puddlemere United; I saw him at the World Cup last year. '\n    'Oh, I saw you there, too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn't it? '\n    The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her - no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione - and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson. 'Potter and Chang! ' screeched Pansy, to a chorus of snide giggles. 'Urgh, Chang, I don't think much of your taste . . . at least Diggory was good-looking! '\n    The girls sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet. 'So . . . where d'you want to go? ' Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements. 'Oh . . . I don't mind,' said Cho, shrugging. 'Urn . . . shall we just have a look in the shops or something? '\n    They wandered towards Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters. The poster, 'By Order of the Ministry of Magic', offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured. It's funny, isn't it,' said Cho in a low voice, gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters, 'remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were Dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are no Dementors anywhere . . . '\n    'Yeah,' said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange's face to glance up and down the High Street. 'Yeah, that is weird. He wasn't sorry that there were no Dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. The) had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they weren't bothering to look for them . . . it looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now. The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed. Scrivenshaft's; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry's face and the back of his neck. 'Um . . . d'you want to get a coffee? ' said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily. 'Yeah, all right,' said Harry, looking around. 'Where? '\n    'Oh, there's a really nice place just up here; haven't you ever been to Madam Puddifoot's? ' she said brightly, leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbndge's office. 'Cute, isn't it? ' said Cho happily. 'Er . . . yeah,' said Harry untruthfully. 'Look, she's decorated it for Valentine's Day! ' said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants. 'Aaah . . . '\n    They sat down at the last remaining table, which was over by the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the teashop, he saw that t was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand. 'What can I get you, m'dears? ' said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies's with great difficulty. Two coffees, please,' said Cho. In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn't; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he couldn't see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he would have to look at Cho, he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub. After a few more painful minutes, Cho mentioned Umbridge. Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during DA meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say. 'Er . . ."

'\n    'She's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren't looking,' said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books. 'Oh,' said George, looking mildly impressed. 'Well - that'd explain it. '\n    'Has Ron saved a goal yet? ' asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms. 'Well, he can do it if he doesn't think anyone's watching him,' said Fred, rolling his eyes. 'So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Qua! fie goes up his end on Saturday. '\n    He got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds. 'You know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for. '\n    Hermione cast him a stern look. 'You've got exams coming! '\n    'Told you already, we're not fussed about NEWTs,' said Fred. 'The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of Murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us on to it. '\n    George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky. 'I dunno if I even want to watch this match. 11 Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself. '\n    'Kill him, more like,' said Fred firmly. 'That's the trouble with Quidditch,' said Hermione absent-mindedly, once again bent over her Runes translation, 'it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses. '\n    She looked up to find her copy of Spellman's Syllabary, and caught Fred, George and Harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces. 'Well, it does! ' she said impatiently. 'It's only a game, isn't it? '\n    'Hermione,' said Harry, shaking his head, 'you're good on feelings and stuff, but you just don't understand about Quidditch. '\n    'Maybe not,' she said darkly, returning to her translation, 'but at least my happiness doesn't depend on Ron's goalkeeping ability. '\n    And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either. The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron's fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby's nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty. 'Good catch,' Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral. 'I was lucky,' she shrugged. 'It wasn't a very fast Snitch and Summerby's got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once you're back on the team - '\n    'Ginny, I've got a lifelong ban. '\n    'You're banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,' Ginny corrected him. There's a difference. Anyway, once you're back, I think\n    I'll, try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway'\n    Harry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of Butlerbeer clutched in his hand. 'Angelina still won't let him resign,' Ginny said, as though reading Harry's mind. 'She says she knows he's got it in him. '\n    Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of 'Weasley is our King' sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favourites to win the Quidditch Cup. Fred and George wandered over. 'I haven't even got the heart to take the mickey out of him,' said Fred, looking over at Ron's crumpled figure. 'Mind you . . . when he missed the fourteenth - '\n    He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright dcggy-paddle. ' - well, I'll save it for parties, eh? '\n    Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible. Harry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite impressed by Ginny's performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner . . . there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke's ankle; if Ginny hadn't hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her wide toad's mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson. He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron's snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down. He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the DA. But when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door. He walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it . . . he was feet from it, and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side . . . the door was ajar . . . he stretched out his hand to push it wide and - '\n    Ron gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen the door, but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron . . . if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute. *\nThey entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught. She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire year, he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake. 'Who're you after? ' he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the recipient's name and address:\nHarry Potter\nGreat Hall\nHogwarts School\nFrowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first. 'What's going on? ' Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting and flapping their wings. 'Harry! ' said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. 'I think I know what this means - open this one first! '\n    Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of the March edition of The Quibbler. He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across this picture were the words:\nHARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST:\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED\nAND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN\n'It's good, isn't it? ' said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between Fred and Ron. 'It came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,' she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, 'are letters from readers. '\n    Thais what I thought,' said Hermione eagerly. Harry, d'you mind if we - ? '\n    'Help yourself,' said Harry, feeling slightly bemused. Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes. 'This one's from a bloke who thinks you're off your rocker,' said Ron, glancing down his letter. 'Ah well . . . '\n    This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St Mungo's,' said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second. This one looks OK, though,' said Harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley. 'Hey she says she believes me! '\n    This one's in two minds,' said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm. 'Says you don't come across as a mad person, but he really doesn't want to believe You-Know-Who's back so he doesn't know what to think now. Blimey, what a waste of parchment. '\n    'Here's another one you've convinced, Harry! ' said Hermione excitedly. 'Having read your side of the story, I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly . . . little though I want to think that He Who Must Not Be Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth . . . Oh, this is wonderful! '\n    'Another one who thinks you're barking,' said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder '. . . but this one says you've got her converted and she now thinks you're a real hero - she's put in a photograph, too - wow! '\n    'What is going on here? ' said a falsely sweet, girlish voice. Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad's eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry. Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly. 'Why have you got all these letters, Mr Potter? ' she asked slowly. 'Is that a crime now? ' said Fred loudly. 'Getting mail? '\n    'Be careful, Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention,' said Umbridge. 'Well, Mr Potter? '\n    Harry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridge's attention. 'People have written to me because I gave an interview,' said Harry. 'About what happened to me last June. '\n    For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. Harry had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked towards the Headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick. 'An interview?"

'As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal. '\n    Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 'You didn't watch?

'But Ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to! '\n    'Yeah? ' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 'How come? '\n    'It was Hagrid,' said Harry. 'He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. Anyway . . . \"\n    The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity. 'He brought one back and hid it in the Forest? '\n    'Yep,' said Harry grimly. 'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 'No, he can't have. '\n    'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly. 'Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, 'as Hermy. '\n    Ron gave a nervous laugh. 'And Hagrid wants us to . . . ? '\n    Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry. 'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice. 'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. 'Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise. '\n    'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly. 'I mean, come on . . . we've got exams and we're about that far - ' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching '- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates? '\n    'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice. Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied. 'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all. '\n*\nThe castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last. Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days. She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices. 'How many hours d'you think you're doing a day? ' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes. 'I dunno,' said Ron. 'A few. '\n    'More or less than eight? '\n    'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed. 'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. 'Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday - '\n    Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic. 'Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, 'it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years - old Griselda Marchbanks - we've had her round for dinner and everthing . . . '\n    'Do you think that's true? ' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron. 'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily. 'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them. 'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's. '\n    'What's she like, Neville? ' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict? '\n    'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice. 'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it? ' Ron told him encouragingly. 'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad . . . well . . . you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\n    Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital. Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet. 'Hermione, we wanted to buy that! ' shouted Ron. 'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it. '\n    'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw? ' said Ron eagerly. 'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know. '\n    'Dragon claw does work! ' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '\n    This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly. 'I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried Doxy droppings. '\n    This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants. They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson. 'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night. 'Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new - Headmistress - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt '- has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - '\n    Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare. ' - however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about. '\n    'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results? '\n    'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall. 'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays. '\n    Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought dully', at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer. Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming. 'Why don't you just do it yourself? ' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering. Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table. Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate. 'Oh, my goodness,' she said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall. 'Is that them? Is that the examiners? '\n    Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous. 'Shall we go and have a closer look? ' said Ron. Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart. 'Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before! ' she said impatiently. 'Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately! ' she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. 'No idea where he is, I suppose? '\n    'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. 'But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough. '\n    'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, 'not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found!"

                "text": "Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing. \"What's wrong with this thing? \" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry's foot. Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle's lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini's temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy's forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe's comic directly\nbelow him. \"So, Zabini,\" said Malfoy, \"what did Slughorn want? \"\n\"Just trying to make up to well-connected people,\" said Zabini,\nwho was still glowering at Goyle. \"Not that he managed to find\nmany. \"\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy. \"Who else had he invited? \" he demanded. \"McLaggen from Gryffindor,\" said Zabini. \"Oh yeah, his uncle's big in the Ministry,\" said Malfoy. \"? someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw ? quot;\n\"Not him, he's a prat! \" said Pansy. \"? and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,\" finished Zabini. Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy's hand aside. \"He invited Longbottom? . \"\n\"Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\" said Zabini indifferently. \"What's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn? \"\nZabini shrugged. \"Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at 'the Chosen One,'\" sneered Malfoy, \"but that Weasley girl! What's so special about her? ? /p> \n\"A lot of boys like her,\" said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \"Even you think she's good-looking, don't you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please! \"I wouldn't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\" said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. \"Well, I pity Slughorn's taste. Maybe he's going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn't heard I'm on the train, or ? quot;\n\"I wouldn't bank on an invitation,\" said Zabini. \"He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived. They used to be old\nfriends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry he didn't look happy, and Nott didn't get an invitation, did he? 1 don't think Slughorn's interested in Dearh Eaters. \"\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh. \"Well, who cares what he's interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher. \" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \"I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what's it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not? \"\n\"What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year? \" said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once. \"Well, you never know,\" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \"I might have ? er ? moved on to bigger and better things. \"\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry's heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair, looking dumbfounded. \"Do you mean \nMalfoy shrugged. \"Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don't see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . . When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many OWLs or N. E. W. T. S anyone's got? Of course he isn't? It'll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown. \"\n\"And you think you'll be able to do something for him? \" asked\nZabini scathingly. \"Sixteen years old and noi even fully qualified yet? \"\n\"I've just said, haven't I? Maybe he doesn't care if I'm qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn't something that you need to be qualified for,\" said Malfoy quietly. Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring. \"I can see Hogwarts,\" said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \"We'd better get our robes on. \"\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning. Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck. Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out\ninto a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed. \"You go on,\" Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \"I just want to check something. \"\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again. Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend? \"Petrificus Totalus! \"\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy's feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn't move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly. \"I thought so,\" he said jubilantly. \"I heard Goyle's trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . . \"\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry's trainers. \"You didn't hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I've got you here . . . \"\n-=-Him\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry's face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere. \"That's from my father. Now, let's see. . . . \"\nMalfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry's immobilized body and threw it over him. \"I don't reckon they'll find you till the trains back in London,\" he said quietly. \"See you around, Potter . . . or not. \"\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry's fingers, Malfoy left the compartment. Chapter 8:  Victorious Snape\n\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the _ Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, would surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him. Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in. . . and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk. Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London. He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \"Accio Wand! \" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened. He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson. The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \"Wotcher, Harry. \"\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry's body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibiliiv Cloak she had just pulled away. We'd better get out of here, quickly,\" she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. \"Come on, we'll jump. \"\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view. The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak. ��Who did it? \"\n��Draco Malfoy,�� said Harry bitterly. \"Thanks for. . . well. . . \" \n��No problem,�� said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \"I can fix your nose if you stand still."

                "text": "What is it you're after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once? \" \n  \nVoldemort sneered. \"If you do not want to give me a job ��\" \n  \n\"Of course I don't,\" said Dumbledore. \"And I don't think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose. \" \n  \nVoldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. \"This is your final word? \" \n  \n\"It is,\" said Dumbledore, also standing. \"Then we have nothing more to say to each other. \" \n  \n\"No, nothing,\" said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. \"The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I wish I could. . . . \" \n  \nFor a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort's hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone. Harry felt Dumbledore's hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore's hand was blackened and dead-looking once more. \"Why? \" said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore's face. \"Why did he come back? Did you ever find out? \" \n  \n\"I have ideas,\" said Dumbledore, \"but no more than that. \" \n  \n\"What ideas, sir? \" \n  \n\"I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\" said Dumbledore. \"When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us. \" \n  \nHarry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once. \"Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn't say. . . . \" \n  \n\"Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,\" said Dumbledore. \"The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort. \" \n\nChapter 21: The Unknowable Room\nHarry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before. \"You won't find anything in there,\" said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening. \"Don't start, Hermione,\" said Harry. \"If it hadn't been for the Prince, Ron wouldn't be sitting here now. \" \n  \n\"He would if you'd just listened to Snape in our first year,\" said Hermione dismissively. Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation ��Sectum-sempra! \" scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words \"For enemies,\" and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page. They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a cer-tain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade. Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for an-other four months, could not take the test whether ready or not. \"At least you can Apparate, though! \" said Ron tensely. \"You'll have no trouble come July! \" \n  \n\"I've only done it once,\" Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson. Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now. \"I'm telling you, the stupid Prince isn't going to be able to help you with this, Harry! \" said Hermione, more loudly. \"There's only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that's the Imperius Curse, which is illegal ��\" \n  \n\"Yeah, I know that, thanks,\" said Harry, not looking up from the book. \"That's why I'm looking for something different. Dumbledorf says Veritaserum won't do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . . \" \n  \n\"You're going about it the wrong way,\" said Hermione. \"Only you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people can��t. It's not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that ��\" \n  \n\"How do you spell 'belligerent'? \" said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. \"It can't be B �� U �� M ��\" \n  \n\"No, it isn't,\" said Hermione, pulling Ron's essay toward her. \"And 'augury' doesn't begin O �� R �� G either. What kind of quill are you using? \" \n  \n\"It's one of Fred and George's Spell-Check ones, but I think the charm must be wearing off. \" \n  \n\"Yes, it must,\" said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, \"because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'Dug-bogs', and I don't remember you changing your name to 'Roonil Wazlib�� either. \" \n  \n\"Ah no! \" said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. \"Don't say I'll have to write the whole thing out again! \" \n  \n\"It's okay, we can fix it,\" said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand. \"I love you, Hermione,\" said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \"Don't let Lavender hear you saying that. \" \n  \n\"1 won't,\" said Ron into his hands. \"Or maybe I will, then she'll ditch me. \" \n  \n\"Why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it? \" asked Harry. \"You haven't ever chucked anyone, have you? \" said Ron. \"You and Cho just ��\"\n  \n\"Sort of fell apart, yeah,\" said Harry. \"Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,\" said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. \"But the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It's like going out with the giant squid. \" \n  \n\"There,\" said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron's essay. \"Thanks a million,\" said Ron. \"Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion? \" Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince's notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione's quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince's book, yawning, when �� \n  \nCrack! Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, \"Kreacher! \" \n  \nThe house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. \"Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give--\"\n  \nCrack! Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. \"Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter! \" he squeaked, cast-ing Kreacher a resentful look. \"And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their re-ports together! \" \n  \n\"What is this? \" asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. \"What's going on, Harry? \" Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Her-mione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her. \"Well. . . they've been following Malfoy for me,\" he said. \"Night and day,\" croaked Kreacher. \"Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter! \" said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. Hermione looked indignant. \"You haven't slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn't tell him not to ��\"\n  \n\"No, of course I didn't,\" said Harry quickly. \"Dobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything? \" he has-tened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again. \"Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,\" croaked Kreacher at once. \"His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of��\"\n  \n\"Draco Malfoy is a bad boy! \" squeaked Dobby angrily. \"A bad boy who �� who ��\" He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp. \"Thank you, Harry Potter,\" he panted. \"Dobby still finds it dif-ficult to speak ill of his old masters. \" Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, \"But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf! \" \n  \n\"Yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,\" Harry told Kreacher. \"Let's fast forward to where he's actually been going. \" \n  \nKreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, \"Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-geons, he attends his classes in a variety of��\" \n  \n\"Dobby, you tell me,\" said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. \"Has he been going anywhere he shouldn't have? \" \n  \n\"Harry Potter, sir,\" squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, \"the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters ��\" \n  \n\"The Room of Requirement! \" said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. \"That's where he's been sneaking off to! That's where he's doing�� whatever he's doing! And I bet that's why he's been disappearing off the map �� come to think of it, I've never seen the Room of Requirement on there! \" \n  \n\"Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,\" said Ron. \"I think it'll be part of the magic of the room,\" said Hermione. \"If you need it to be unplottable, it will be. \"\n  \n\"Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy's doing? \" said Harry eagerly. \"No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,\" said Dobby. \"No, it's not,\" said Harry at once. \"Malfoy got into our head-quarters there last year, so I'll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem. \" \n  \n\"But I don't think you will, Harry,\" said Hermione slowly. \"Mal-foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn't he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D. A. , so it did."

                "text": "\"Do you know what I think, Potter? \" said Snape, very quietly. \"I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. \"What do you think, Potter? \" \n\"I �� I don't agree, sir,\" said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape's eyes. \"Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,\" said Snape. \"Ten o'clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office. \" \n\"But sir . . . \" said Harry, looking up desperately. \"Quidditch . . . the last match of the . . . \" \n\"Ten o'clock,\" whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. \"Poor Gryffindor. . . fourth place this year, I fear . . . \" \nAnd he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life. \"I won't say 'I told you so,'\" said Hermione, an hour later in the common room. \"Leave it, Hermione,\" said Ron angrily. Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape's punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term. \"I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,\" Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. \"And I was right, wasn't I. \" \n\"No, I don't think you were,\" said Harry stubbornly. He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team's faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginny's eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . . \"Harry,\" said Hermione, \"how can you still stick up for that book when that spell ��\" \n\"Will you stop harping on about the book! \" snapped Harry. \"The Prince only copied it out! It's not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him! \" \n\"I don't believe this,\" said Hermione. \"You're actually defending�� \n\"I'm not defending what I did! \" said Harry quickly. \"I wish 1 ; hadn't done it, and not just because I've got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn't've used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can't blame the Prince, he hadn't written 'try this out, it's really good' �� he was just making notes for himself, wasn't he, not for anyone else. . . . \" \n\"Are you telling me,\" said Hermione, \"that you're going to go back �� ? \" \n\"And get the book? Yeah, I am,\" said Harry forcefully. \"Listen, without the Prince I'd never have won the Felix Felicis. I'd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I'd never have ��\" \n\"�� got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don't deserve,\" said Hermione nastily. \"Give it a rest, Hermione! \" said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. \"By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve! \" \n\"Well, of course I'm glad Harry wasn't cursed! \" said Hermione, clearly stung. \"But you can't call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it's landed him! And I'd have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match ��\" \n\"Oh, don't start acting as though you understand Quidditch,\" snapped Ginny, \"you'll only embarrass yourself. \" \nHarry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, \nlittle though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan. \"Ah, Potter,\" said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them. \"Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\" said Snape softly. \"They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic. \" \n\"Right, Professor,\" said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables. \"I thought you could start,\" said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, \"with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . . \" \nHe pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, \"James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubreys head twice normal size. Double detention. \" Snape sneered. \"It must be such a comforting thing that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains. \" \nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him. It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius's names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . . Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . . Harry's stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one. \"I think that will do,\" he said coldly. \"Mark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o'clock next Saturday. \" Yes, sir. Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. . . . It was over, then. . . . He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room. \"Quid agis? \" he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside. Her expression was unreadable as she replied, \"You'll see. \" \nAnd she swung forward. A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room. \"We won! \" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. \"We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won! \" \nHarry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments �� or it might have been half an hour �� or possibly several sunlit days �� they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well��if you must. The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which �� if they had time �� they might discuss the match. Chapter 25: The Seer Overheard \n\n\nThe fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in hor-rific scenes of Dark magic. 'You'd think people had better things to gossip about,' said Ginny, as she sat on the common-room floor, leaning against Harry's legs and reading the Daily Prophet. Three Dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it's true you've got a Hippogriff tattooed across your chest. ' \nRon and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them. 'What did you tell her? ' \n' ? told her it's a Hungarian Horntail,' said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. 'Much more macho. ' \nThanks,' said Harry, grinning. 'And what did you tell her Ron's got? ' \n'A Pygmy Puff, but I didn't say where. ' \nRon scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing. 'Watch it,' he said, pointing wamingly at Harry and Ginny. 'Just because I've given my permission doesn't mean I can't withdraw it -' \n\"Tour permission\",' scoffed Ginny. 'Since when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you'd rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean. ' \n'Yeah, 1 would,' said Ron grudgingly. 'And just as long as you don't start snogging each other in public -' \n'You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrash-ing around like a pair of eels all over the place? ' demanded Ginny. But Ron's tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny's time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny's O. W. L. s were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology home-work but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face. 'I want to talk to you, Harry."

                "text": "A \ndesk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and \nGinny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now \nhoused a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny's \nwindow. Ginny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, \"Happy \nseventeenth. \" \n\n\"Yeah. . . thanks. \" \n\nShe was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; \nit was like gazing into a brilliant light. \"Nice view,\" he said feebly, pointing toward with window. She ignored this. He could not blame her. \"I couldn't think what to get you,\" she said. \"You didn't have to get me anything. \" \n\nShe disregarded this too. \"I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn't be \nable to take it with you. \" \n\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many \nwonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that \nhaving six brothers must have toughened her up. She took a step closer to him. \"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, \nif you meet some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing. \" \n\n\"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be \nhonest. \" \n\n\"There's the silver lining I've been looking for,\" she whispered, and then she was \nkissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it \nwas blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, \nGinny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-- \n\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. \"Oh,\" said Ron pointedly. \"Sorry. \" \n\n\"Ron! \" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained \nsilence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, \n\n\"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry. \" \n\nRon's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door \nin their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door \nopened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for \nending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk \ninside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone. He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but \nshe had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to \ntears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron. \"I'll see you later,\" he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. Ron marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and \nHarry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking \nscared. Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. \"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around? \" \n\n\"I'm not messing her around,\" said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. \"Ron--\" \n\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her. \"She was really cut up when you ended it--\" \n\n\"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to. \" \n\n\"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up \nagain--\" \n\n\"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to--to end up \nmarried, or--\" \n\nAs he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, \nmarrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and \nunencumbered, whereas his. . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. \"If you keep groping her every chance you get--\" \n\n\"It won't happen again,\" said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as \nthough the sun had gone in. \"Okay? \" \n\nRon looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his \nfeet for a moment, then said, \"Right then, well, that's. . . yeah. \" \n\nGinny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, \nnor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite \nconversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It \nprovided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand \nthreateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut. As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking \npoint even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were \nplaced end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns \nall emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's ministrations, George's wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used \nto the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins' many jokes about it. Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and \ndrape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes. \"Nice,\" said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione \n\n \n\nturned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. \"You've really got an eye for that sort of \nthing. \" \n\n\f\n\"Thank you, Ron! \" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a \nchapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe \nWays to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering \nhis promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour. \"Out of the way, out of the way! \" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate \nwith what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds \nlater Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending \nwith her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had \nfinally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, \n\n\"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley. \" \n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, dear,\" she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the \nthumbs-up and mouthed, Good one. By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, \nwho had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by \nwearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook \nHarry's hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside \nhim, looked simply radiant. \"Happy birthday, Harry,\" she said, hugging him tightly. \"Seventeen, eh! \" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from \nFred. \"Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it? \" \n\n \n\n\"Vaguely,\" said Harry, grinning up at him. \"Didn't you smash down the front door, \ngive Dudley a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard? \" \n\n\"I forge' the details,\" Hagrid chortled. \"All righ', Ron, Hermione? \" \n\n\"We're fine,\" said Hermione. \"How are you? \" \n\n\"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh \nget back--\" Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. \"Here. Harry -- couldn't think what ter get teh, but then I remembered this. \" He pulled out \na small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn \naround the neck. \"Mokeskin. Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. They're rare, them. \" \n\n\"Hagrid, thanks! \" \n\n\"'S'nothin',\" said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. \"An' there's \nCharlie! Always liked him -- hey! Charlie! \" \n\nCharlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short \nhaircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his \nmuscley arms. \"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going? \" \n\n\"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'? \" \n\n\"Norbert? \" Charlie laughed. \"The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta \nnow. \" \n\n\"Wha -- Norbert's a girl? \" \n\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Charlie. \"How can you tell? \" asked Hermione. \"They're a lot more vicious,\" said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and \ndropped his voice. \"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy. \" \n\n \n\nThey all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour \nwhile glancing repeatedly at the gate. \"I think we'd better start without Arthur,\" she called to the garden at large after a \nmoment or two. \"He must have been held up at -- oh! \" \n\nThey all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard \nand onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its \nhind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley's voice. \"Minister of Magic coming with me. \" \n\nThe Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in \nastonishment at the place where it had vanished. \"We shouldn't be here,\" said Lupin at once. \"Harry -- I'm sorry -- I'll explain some \nother time--\" \n\nHe seized Tonks��s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed \nover it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. \"The Minister -- but why--? I don't understand--\" \n\nBut there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had \nappeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly \nrecognizable by his mane of grizzled hair. The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit \ntable, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came \nwithin range of the lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time \nthat had met, scraggy and grim. \"Sorry to intrude,\" said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party. \" \n\n \n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. \"Many happy returns. \" \n\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry. \"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald \nWeasley and Miss Hermione Granger. \" \n\n\"Us? \" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why us? \" \n\n\"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is \nthere such a place? ' he demanded of Mr. Weasley. \"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, \nwhy don't you use that? \" \n\n\"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you \nto accompany us, Arthur. \" \n\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, \nand Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew \nthat the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had \nlearned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into \nthe Burrow's sitting room."

                "text": "��She��s Mafalda Hopkirk,�� he said, reading a small card that identified their victim \nas an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. ��You��d better take this, Hermione, \nand here are the tokens. �� \n\n He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M. O. M. , \nwhich he had taken from the witch��s purse. Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, \nand within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed \nMafalda��s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch. ��We��re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second. �� \n\n They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the \nInvisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds \nlater there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them. ��Oh, hello, Mafalda. �� \n\n ��Hello! �� said Hermione in a quavery voice, ��How are you today? �� \n\n ��Not so good, actually,�� replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly \ndowncast. As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along \nbehind them. ��I��m sorry to hear you��re under the weather,�� said Hermione, talking firmly over \nthe little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him \nfrom reaching the street. ��Here, have a sweet. �� \n\n ��Eh? Oh, no thanks �C�� \n\n ��I insist! �� said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the \nlittle wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a \nhandful of hairs from the top of his head. ��Oh dear! �� she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. ��Perhaps you��d better \ntake the day off! �� \n\n ��No �C no! �� He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being \nunable to walk straight. ��I must �C today �C must go �C �� \n\n\f\n ��But that��s just silly! �� said Hermione, alarmed. ��You can��t go to work in this state \n�C I think you ought to go to St. Mungo��s and get them to sort you out. �� \n\n The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the \nmain street. ��You simply can��t go to work like this! �� cried Hermione. At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to \nclaw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving \nnothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying \nchunks of vomit. ��Urgh,�� said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of \nsick. ��It would have made much less mess to Stun him too. �� \n\n ��Yeah,�� said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard��s bag, ��but I \nstill think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on \nhis job, though, isn��t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then. �� \n\n Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick \nwizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. ��Weird he wasn��t wearing them today, wasn��t it, seeing how much he wanted to \ngo? Anyway, I��m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back. �� \n\n ��Now wait here,�� Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \n��and we��ll be back with some hairs for you. �� \n\n He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in \nthe sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron \nand Hermione reappeared. ��We don��t know who he is,�� Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black \nhairs, ��but he��s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he��s pretty tall, you��ll need \nbigger robes  \n\n She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry \nretired to take the potion and change. Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, \nfrom what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a \nbeard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the \nother two. ��Blimey, that��s scary,�� said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him. ��Take one of Mafalda��s tokens,�� Hermione told Harry, ��and let��s go, it��s nearly \nnine. �� \n\n They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded \npavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled \nGENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. ��See you in a moment, then,�� said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down \nthe steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending \ninto what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and \nwhite. ��Morning, Reg! �� called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a \ncubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. ��Blooming pain in the bum, \nthis, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry \nPotter? �� \n\n\f\n The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. ��Yeah,�� he said, ��stupid, isn��t it? �� \n\n And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. To Harry��s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and \npeered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted \nfeet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him. ��We have to flush ourselves in? �� he whispered. ��Looks like it,�� Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly. They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be \nstanding in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the \nchain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into \nthe Ministry of Magic. He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain \nhad filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished \nwooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was \nrather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved \nthrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just \nflown out of the fireplace behind him. ��Out of the way, can��t y �C oh, sorry, Runcorn. �� \n\n Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who \nHarry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. ��Psst! �� said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the \nferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them. ��You got in all right, then? �� Hermione whispered to Harry. ��No, he��s still stuck in the hog,�� said Ron. ��Oh, very funny �� It��s horrible, isn��t it? �� she said to Harry, who was staring up \nat the statue. ��Have you seen what they��re sitting on? �� \n\n Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were \ndecoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and \nhundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, \ntwisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards. ��Muggles,�� whispered Hermione, ��In their rightful place. Come on, let��s get \ngoing. �� \n\n They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at \nthe end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of \nthe distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a \nsmaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as \nmany lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, ��Cattermole! �� \n\n They looked around: Harry��s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who \nhad witnessed Dumbledore��s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers \nbeside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man��s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, \nsweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd \naround the lifts called sycophantically, ��Morning, Yaxley! �� Yaxley ignored them. ��I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, \nCattermole. It��s still raining in there. �� \n\n Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody \nspoke. ��Raining �� in your office? That��s �C that��s not good, is it? �� \n\n Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley��s eyes widened. ��You think it��s funny, Cattermole, do you? �� \n\n A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. ��No,�� said Ron, ��no, of course �C�� \n\n ��You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, \nCattermole? In fact, I��m quite surprised you��re not down there holding her hand while \nshe waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and \nmarry a pureblood next time. �� \n\n Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough \nfeebly and turned away. ��I �C I �C�� stammered Ron. ��But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,�� said Yaxley, not that any \nwoman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth �C and the Head of Department of \nMagical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, \nCattermole. Do you understand me? �� \n\n ��Yes,�� whispered Ron. ��Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an \nhour, your wife��s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now. �� \n\n The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to \nHarry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley \nswept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody \nfollowed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift \nbegan to move upward. ��What am I going to do? �� Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. ��If \nI don��t turn up, my wife �� I mean, Cattermole��s wife �C �� \n\n ��We��ll come with you, we should stick together �C�� began Harry, but Ron shook \nhis head feverishly. ��That��s mental, we haven��t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I��ll go and \nsort out Yaxley��s office �C but how do I stop a raining?"

Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own \nheart; It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation. \"Have you got anything for me? \" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-\ntip. \"Have you got anything for me? \" he repeated. Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry's scar prickled \npainfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, \nfetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: \nHold him! Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him \nagain; he did not know what had just happened. \"Have you got anything for me? \" he asked for a third time, much louder. \"Over here,\" she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the \noutline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand \nraised. He did not want to look away from her. \"What is it? \" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what \nlooked and smelled like dirty laundry. \"There,\" she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, \na ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn \nand horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring \nfrom the place where her neck had been. The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand \nspinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was \nextinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of \nhim: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing -- \nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the \ntable where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him \nas he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, \"Harry? \" \n\n\n\f\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass \nsmashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular -- \n\"No! \" he gasped, pinned to the floor. \"Yes,\" whispered the voice. \"Yesss. . . hold you . . . hold you . . . \" \n\"Accio . . . Accio Wand . . . \" \nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it \ncoiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into \nhis chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his \nbrain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, \ndistant footsteps, everything going. . . A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph \nin his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral. . . He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He \nscrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and \nHermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which \nshattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken \nglass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something -- his wand -- \nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; \nHermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then \nthere was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking \nHarry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry \nraised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it \nhad done in years. \"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming! \" \nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves \nfrom the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and \nseized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione -- \nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but \nHarry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his \nhead was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- \nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, \nHermione screamed, \"Confringo! \" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the \nwardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt \nthe heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, \nhe leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window \n\n\f\ninto nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair . . . And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid \nbedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man \nand the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled \nwith the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in \nChristmas Day. . . And his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain. . . that it could happen here, \nwhere it had happened before. . . here, within sight of that house where he had come so \nclose to knowing what it was to die . . . to die . . . the pain was so terrible . . . ripped from his \nbody . . . But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold \nhe feel so unbearably, didn't pain cease with death, didn't it go . . . The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square \nand the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a \nworld in which they did not believe . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose \nand power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions . . . Not anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes . . . He had waited for this, he had \nhoped for it . . . \"Nice costume, mister! \" \nHe saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the \ncloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: Then the child turned and ran away . . . Beneath \nthe robe he fingered the handle of his wand . . . One simple movement and the child would \nnever reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary . . . And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, \nthe Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet . . . And he made less noise \nthan the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, \nand steered over it . . . They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the \ntall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand \nfor the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was \nlaughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist . . . A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he cold not hear, her long dark-red \nhair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the \nmother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white \nhand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open. . . He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he \n\n\f\nhad not even picked up his wand . . . \"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off! \" \nHold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He laughed before casting the curse . . . \"Avada Kedavra! \" \nThe green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it \nmade the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose \nstrings were cut . . . He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was \nsensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear . . . He climbed the steps, listening with faint \namusement to her attempts to barricade herself in . . . She had no wand upon her either . . . How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that \nweapons could be discarded even for moments. . . He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one \nlazy wave of his wand . . . and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, \nshe dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would \nhelp, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead . . . \"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry! \" \n\"Stand aside, you silly girl. . . stand aside, now. \" \n\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\" \n\"This is my last warning --\" \n\"Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy . . . Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -- I'll \ndo anything . . . \" \n\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl! \" \nHe could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them \nall . . . The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had \nnot cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up \ninto the intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his \nfather who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop \nup any moment, laughing -- \nHe pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: He wanted to see it happen, the \n\n\f\ndestruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen that he \nwas not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small \nones whining in the orphanage -- \n\"Avada Kedavra! \" \nAnd then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, \nnot here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far \naway . . . far away . . . \"No,\" he moaned. The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was \nthe boy . . . \"No. . . \" \nAnd now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of \nhis greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass. . . He \nlooked down and saw something. . . something incredible. . . \"No. . . \" \n\"Harry, it's all right, you're all right! \" \nHe stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown \nthief, the thief he was seeking. . . \"No. . . I dropped it. . . I dropped it . . . \" \n\"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up! \" \nHe was Harry. . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that was rustling was not a snake . . . He opened his eyes. \"Harry,\" Hermione whispered. \"Do you feel all -- all right? \" \n\"Yes,\" he lied. He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could \ntell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the \ncanvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. \"We got away. \" \n\"Yes,\" said Hermione. \"I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't \n\n\f\nlift you. You've been . . . Well, you haven't been quite . . ."
